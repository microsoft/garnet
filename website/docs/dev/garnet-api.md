The **IGarnetApi** interface contains the operators exposed to the public API, which ultimately perform operations over the keys stored in Garnet. It inherits from **IGarnetReadApi** (read-only commands interface) and **IGarnetAdvancedApi** (advanced API calls). 

For adding an new operator or command to the API, add a new method signature to the **IGarnetReadApi** interface in case the command performs read-only operations, or **IGarnetApi** otherwise.

### Adding a new command to Garnet

_If you are trying to add a command for your specific Garnet server instance, see [Custom Commands](custom-commands.md)_

To add a new command to Garnet, follow these steps:

1. If your command operates on an **object** (i.e. List, SortedSet etc.), add a new enum value to the ```[ObjectName]Operation``` enum in ```Garnet.server/Objects/[ObjectName]/[ObjectName]Object.cs```\
Otherwise, add a new enum value to the ```RespCommand``` enum in ```Garnet.server/Resp/RespCommand.cs```.
2. Add the parsing logic of the new command name to ```Garnet.server/Resp/RespCommand.cs```. If the command has a **fixed number of arguments**, add parsing logic to the **FastParseCommand** method. Otherwise, add parsing logic to the **FastParseArrayCommand** method. 
3. Add a new method signature to **IGarnetReadApi**, in case the command performs read-only operations, or to **IGarnetApi** otherwise (```Garnet.server/API/IGarnetAPI.cs```).
4. Add a new method to the **RespServerSession** class. This method will parse the command from the network buffer, call the storage layer API (method declared in step #3) and write the RESP formatted response back to the network buffer (note that the **RespServerSession** class is divided across several .cs files, object-specific commands will reside under ```Garnet.server/Resp/Objects/[ObjectName]Commands.cs```, while others will reside under ```Garnet.server/Resp/[Admin|Array|Basic|etc...]Commands.cs```, depending on the command type).
5. Back in ```Garnet.server/Resp/RespCommand.cs```, add the new command case to the **ProcessBasicCommands** or **ProcessArrayCommands** method respectively, calling the method that was added in step #4.
6. Add a new method to the **StorageSession** class. This method is part of the storage layer. This storage API ONLY performs the RMW or Read operation calls, and it wraps the Tsavorite API.  (note that the **StorageSession** class is divided across several .cs files, **object store** operations will reside under ```Garnet.server/Storage/Session/ObjectStore/[ObjectName]Ops.cs```, while **main store** operations will mainly reside under ```Garnet.server/Storage/Session/MainStore/MainStoreOps.cs```, with some exceptions).\
To implement the storage-level logic of the new command, follow these guidelines according to the new command type:
    * ***Single-key object store command***: If you are adding a command that operates on a single object, the implementation of this method will simply be a call ```[Read|RMW]ObjectStoreOperation[WithOutput]```, which in turn will call the ```Operate``` method in ```Garnet.server/Objects/[ObjectName]/[ObjectName]Object.cs```, where you will have to add a new case for the command and and the object-specific command implementation in ```Garnet.server/Objects/[ObjectName]/[ObjectName]ObjectImpl.cs```
    * ***Multi-key object store command***: If you are adding a command that operates on multiple objects, you may need to create a transaction in which you will appropriately lock the keys (using the ```TransactionManager``` instance). You can then operate on multiple objects (for instance using the ```GET``` & ```SET``` operations).
    * ***Main-store command***: If you are adding a command that operates on the main store, you'll need to call Tsavorite's ```Read``` or ```RMW``` methods. If you are calling ```RMW```, you will need to implement the initialization and in-place / copy update functionality of the new command in ```Garnet.server/Storage/Functions/MainStore/RMWMethods.cs```.
7. If the command supports being called in a transaction context, add a new case for the command in the ```TransactionManager.GetKeys``` method and return the appropriate key locks required by the command (```Garnet.server/Transaction/TxnKeyManager.cs```). 
8. Add tests that run the command and check its output under valid and invalid conditions, test using both ```SE.Redis``` and ```LightClient```, if applicable. For object commands, add tests to ```Garnet.test/Resp[ObjectName]Tests.cs```. For other commands, add to ```Garnet.test/RespTests.cs``` or ```Garnet.test/Resp[AdminCommands|etc...]Tests.cs```, depending on the command type.
9. Add newly supported command documentation to the appropriate markdown file under ```website/docs/commands/```, and specify the command as supported in ```website/docs/commands/api-compatibility.md```.
10. Add command info by following the next [section](#adding-supported-command-info)

:::tip
Before you start implementing your command logic, add a basic test that calls the new command, it will be easier to debug and implement missing logic as you go along.

### Adding command info

Each supported RESP command in Garnet should have an entry in ```Garnet.server/Resp/RespCommandsInfo.json```, specifying the command's info.\
A command's info can be added manually, but we recommend using the ```CommandInfoUpdater``` tool to update the JSON file (can be found under ```playground/```).

The ```CommandInfoUpdater``` tool calculates the difference between existing commands in ```Garnet.server/Resp/RespCommandsInfo.json``` and commands specified in ```CommandInfoUpdater/SupportedCommands.cs```. It then attempts to add / remove commands' info as necessary.\
Info for Garnet-only commands is retrieved from ```CommandInfoUpdater/GarnetCommandsInfo.json```, and info for other RESP commands is retrieved from an external RESP server (which you will need to run locally / have access to in order to run this tool).

To add command info to Garnet, follow these steps:
1. Add the supported command and its supported sub-commands (if applicable) to ```CommandInfoUpdater/SupportedCommands.cs```.
2. If you are adding a Garnet-specific command, add its info to ```CommandInfoUpdater/GarnetCommandsInfo.json```.
3. Build & run the tool (for syntax help run the tool with `-h` or `--help`).
