# Data Structures

## Hash

### HDEL

#### Syntax

```bash
    HDEL key field [field ...]
```


Removes the specified fields from the hash stored at **key**. Specified fields that do not exist within this hash are ignored. If **key** does not exist, it is treated as an empty hash and this command returns 0.

---

### HEXISTS

#### Syntax

```bash
    HEXISTS key field
```

Returns if field is an existing field in the hash stored at **key**.

---

### HGET

#### Syntax

```bash
    HGET key field
```

Returns the value associated with field in the hash stored at **key**.

---

### HGETALL

#### Syntax

```bash
    HGETALL key
```

Returns all fields and values of the hash stored at **key**. In the returned value, every field name is followed by its value, so the length of the reply is twice the size of the hash.

---

### HINCRBY

#### Syntax

```bash
    HINCRBY key field increment
```

Increments the number stored at field in the hash stored at **key** by increment. 
If **key** does not exist, a new **key** holding a hash is created. If field does not exist the value is set to 0 before the operation is performed.
The range of values supported by HINCRBY is limited to 64 bit signed integers.

---

### HINCRBYFLOAT 

#### Syntax

```bash
    HINCRBYFLOAT key field increment
```

Increment the specified field of a hash stored at **key**, and representing a floating point number, by the specified increment. If the increment value is negative, the result is to have the hash field value decremented instead of incremented. If the field does not exist, it is set to 0 before performing the operation. An error is returned if one of the following conditions occur:

* The field contains a value of the wrong type (not a string).
* The current field content or the specified increment are not parsable as a double precision floating point number.

---

### HKEYS

#### Syntax

```bash
    HKEYS key
```

Returns all field names in the hash stored at **key**.

---

### HLEN {#hlen}

#### Syntax

```bash
    HLEN key
```

Returns the number of fields contained in the hash stored at **key**.

---

### HMGET

#### Syntax

```bash 
    HMGET key field [field ...]
```
Ret
urns the values associated with the specified fields in the hash stored at **key**.

For every field that does not exist in the hash, a nil value is returned. Because non-existing keys are treated as empty hashes, running HMGET against a non-existing **key** will return a list of nil values.

### HMSET

#### Syntax

```bash
    HMSET key field value [field value ...]
```

Deprecated in favor of HSET with multiple field-value pairs.

Sets the specified fields to their respective values in the hash stored at **key**. This command overwrites any specified fields already existing in the hash. If **key** does not exist, a new **key** holding a hash is created.

---

### HRANDFIELD

#### Syntax

```bash
    HRANDFIELD key [count [WITHVALUES]]
```

When called with just the **key** argument, return a random field from the hash value stored at **key**.

If the provided count argument is positive, return an array of distinct fields. The array's length is either count or the hash's number of fields ([HLEN](#hlen)), whichever is lower.

If called with a negative count, the behavior changes and the command is allowed to return the same field multiple times. In this case, the number of returned fields is the absolute value of the specified count.

The optional WITHVALUES modifier changes the reply so it includes the respective values of the randomly selected hash fields.

---

### HSCAN {#hscan}

#### Syntax

```bash
    HSCAN key cursor [MATCH pattern] [COUNT count]
```

Iterates over the fields and values of a hash stored at a given **key**. Same as [SSCAN](#sscan) and [ZSCAN](#zscan) commands, **HSCAN** is used in order to incrementally iterate over the elements of the hash set*.

The **match** parameter allows to apply a filter to elements after they have been retrieved from the collection. The **count** option sets a limit to the maximum number of items returned from the server to this command. This limit is also set in conjunction with the object-scan-count-limit of the global server settings.

---

### HSET    

#### Syntax

```bash
    HSET key field value
```

Sets the specified fields to their respective values in the hash stored at **key**. This command overwrites the values of specified fields that exist in the hash. If **key** does not exist, a new **key** holding a hash is created. 

---

### HSETNX

#### Syntax

```bash
    HSETNX key field value
```

Sets field in the hash stored at **key** to value, only if field does not yet exist. If **key** does not exist, a new **key** holding a hash is created. If field already exists, this operation has no effect.

---

### HSTRLEN

#### Syntax

```bash
    HSTRLEN key field
```

Returns the string length of the value associated with **field** in the hash stored at **key**. If the **key** or the **field** do not exist, 0 is returned.

---

### HVALS

#### Syntax

```bash 
    HVALS key 
```

Returns all values in the hash stored at **key**.

---

## List

### LINDEX

#### Syntax

```bash 
    LINDEX key index
```

Removes the element at index index in the list stored at **key**. The index is zero-based. Negative indices can be used to designate elements starting at the tail of the list.


---

### LINSERT

#### Syntax

```bash
    LINSERT key BEFORE|AFTER pivot element
```

Inserts element in the list stored at **key** either before or after the reference value pivot. When key does not exist, it is considered an empty list and no operation is performed.

---

### LLEN

#### Syntax

```bash
    LLEN key
```

Returns the length of the list stored at key. If key does not exist, it is interpreted as an empty list and 0 is returned. 

---

### LMOVE {#lmove}

#### Syntax

```bash
    LMOVE source destination LEFT|RIGHT LEFT|RIGHT
```

Atomically returns and removes the first/last element (head/tail depending on the wherefrom argument) of the list stored at **source**, and pushes the element at the first/last element (head/tail depending on the whereto argument) of the list stored at **destination**.

This command comes in place of the now deprecated RPOPLPUSH. Doing LMOVE RIGHT LEFT is equivalent.

---

### LPOP

#### Syntax

```bash
    LPOP key [count]
```

Removes and returns the first elements of the list stored at **key**.

By default, the command pops a single element from the beginning of the list. When provided with the optional count argument, the reply will consist of up to count elements, depending on the list's length.

---

### LPUSH

#### Syntax

```bash 
    LPUSH key [element] [element ...]
```

Insert all the specified values at the head of the list stored at **key**. If **key** does not exist, it is created as empty list before performing the push operations. 

---

### LPUSHX

#### Syntax

```bash
    LPUSHX key [element] [element ...]
```

Inserts specified values at the head of the list stored at **key**, only if **key** already exists and holds a list. In contrary to LPUSH, no operation will be performed when **key** does not yet exist.

---

### LRANGE

#### Syntax

```bash
    LRANGE key start stop
```

Returns the specified elements of the list stored at **key**. The offsets start and stop are zero-based indexes, with 0 being the first element of the list (the head of the list), 1 being the next element and so on.

---

### LREM

#### Syntax

```bash
    LREM key count element
```

Removes the first count occurrences of elements equal to element from the list stored at **key**. The **count** argument influences the operation in the following ways:

* **count > 0:**  Remove elements equal to element moving from head to tail.

* **count < 0:** Remove elements equal to element moving from tail to head.

* **count = 0:** Remove all elements equal to element.

---

### LSET

#### Syntax

```bash
    LSET key index element
```

Sets the list element at **index** to **element**. For more information on the index argument, see [LINDEX](#lindex).

An error is returned for out of range indexes.

---

### LTRIM

#### Syntax

```bash
    LTRIM key start stop
```

Trim an existing list so that it will contain only the specified range of elements specified. Both start and stop are zero-based indexes, where 0 is the first element of the list (the head), 1 the next element and so on.

---

### RPOP

#### Syntax

```bash
    RPOP key [count]
```

Removes and returns the last elements of the list stored at **key**.

By default, the command pops a single element from the end of the list. When provided with the optional count argument, the reply will consist of up to count elements, depending on the list's length.

---

### RPOPLPUSH

#### Syntax

```bash
    RPOPLPUSH source destination
```

Atomically returns and removes the last element (tail) of the list stored at source, and pushes the element at the first element (head) of the list stored at destination.

It can be replaced by [LMOVE](#lmove) with the RIGHT and LEFT arguments when migrating or writing new code.

---

### RPUSH {#rpush}

#### Syntax

```bash
    RPUSH key element [element]
```

Insert all the specified values at the tail of the list stored at **key**. If **key** does not exist, it is created as empty list before performing the push operation. 

---

### RPUSHX

#### Syntax

```bash
    RPUSHX key element [element]
```

Inserts specified values at the tail of the list stored at **key**, only if **key** already exists and holds a list. In contrary to [RPUSH](#rpush), no operation will be performed when **key** does not yet exist. 

---

## Set

### SADD

#### Syntax

```bash
    SADD key member [member]
```

Adds the specified members to the set stored at **key**. Specified members that are already a member of this set are ignored. If **key** does not exist, a new set is created before adding the specified members.

---

### SCARD

#### Syntax

```bash
    SCARD key
```

Returns the set cardinality (number of elements) of the set stored at **key**.

```bash
    SISMEMBER key member
```

Returns if **member** is a member of the set stored at **key**.

---

### SRANDMEMBER

#### Syntax

```bash
    SRANDMEMBER key [count]
```

When called with just the **key** argument, return a random element from the set value stored at **key**.

If the provided **count** argument is positive, return an array of **distinct elements**. The array's length is either **count** or the set's cardinality (SCARD), whichever is lower.

If called with a negative **count**, the behavior changes and the command is allowed to return the **same element multiple times**. In this case, the number of returned elements is the absolute value of the specified **count**.

---


### SREM

#### Syntax

```bash
    SREM key member [member]
```

Removes the specified members from the set stored at **key**. Specified members that are not a member of this set are ignored. 

If **key** does not exist, it is treated as an empty set and this command returns 0.

---

### SSCAN

#### Syntax

```bash
    SSCAN key cursor [MATCH pattern] [COUNT count]
```

Iterates elements of Sets types. Same as [HSCAN](#hscan) and [ZSCAN](#zscan) commands, SSCAN is used in order to incrementally iterate over the elements of the set stored at **key**.

The **match** parameter allows to apply a filter to elements after they have been retrieved from the collection. The **count** option sets a limit to the maximum number of items returned from the server to this command. This limit is also set in conjunction with the object-scan-count-limit of the global server settings.

---

### SUNION

#### Syntax

```bash
    SUNION key [key ...]
```

Returns the members of the set resulting from the union of all the given sets.
Keys that do not exist are considered to be empty sets.

---

### SUNIONSTORE

#### Syntax

```bash
    SUNIONSTORE destination key [key ...]
```

This command is equal to [SUNION](#SUNION), but instead of returning the resulting set, it is stored in **destination**.

If **destination** already exists, it is overwritten.

---

### SINTER

#### Syntax

```bash
    SINTER key [key ...]
```

Returns the members of the set resulting from the intersection of all the given sets.
Keys that do not exist are considered to be empty sets.

---

### SINTERSTORE

#### Syntax

```bash
    SINTERSTORE destination key [key ...]
```

This command is equal to [SINTER](#INTER), but instead of returning the resulting set, it is stored in **destination**.

If **destination** already exists, it is overwritten.

**Keys** that do not exist are considered to be empty sets.

---

### SDIFFSTORE

#### Syntax

```bash
    SDIFFSTORE destination key [key ...]
```

This command is equal to [SDIFF](#SDIFF), but instead of returning the resulting set, it is stored in **destination**. 

If **destination** already exists, it is overwritten.

---

## Sorted Set

### ZADD

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZADD key score member [score member ...]
```

Adds all the specified members with the specified scores to the sorted set stored at **key**. It is possible to specify multiple score / member pairs. If a specified member is already a member of the sorted set, the score is updated and the element reinserted at the right position to ensure the correct ordering.

If key does not exist, a new sorted set with the specified members as sole members is created, like if the sorted set was empty. 

The score values should be the string representation of a double precision floating point number.

---

### ZCARD {#zcard}

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZCARD key
```

Returns the sorted set cardinality (number of elements) of the sorted set stored at **key**.

---

### ZCOUNT

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZCOUNT key min max
```

Returns the number of elements in the sorted set at **key** with a score between min and max.

The min and max arguments have the same semantic as described for [ZRANGEBYSCORE](#zrangebyscore).

---

### ZDIFF

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZDIFF numkeys key [key ...] [WITHSCORES]
```

Returns the difference between the first and all successive input sorted sets keys. The total number of input keys is specified by numkeys.

Keys that do not exist are considered to be empty sets.

---

### ZINCRBY

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZINCRBY key increment member
```

Increments the score of member in the sorted set stored at **key** by increment. If member does not exist in the sorted set, it is added with increment as its score (as if its previous score was 0.0). If **key** does not exist, a new sorted set with the specified member as its sole member is created.

An error is returned when **key** exists but does not hold a sorted set.

The score value should be the string representation of a numeric value, and accepts double precision floating point numbers. It is possible to provide a negative value to decrement the score.


---

### ZLEXCOUNT

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZLEXCOUNT key min max
```

When all the elements in a sorted set are inserted with the same score, in order to force lexicographical ordering, this command returns the number of elements in the sorted set at **key** with a value between min and max.

The min and max arguments have the same meaning as described for [ZRANGEBYLEX](#zrangebylex).

---

### ZMSCORE

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZMSCORE key member [member ...]
```

Returns the scores associated with the specified **members** in the sorted set stored at **key**.

For every **member** that does not exist in the sorted set, a nil value is returned.

Returns one of the following:

_Nil reply:_ if the member does not exist in the sorted set.\
_Array reply:_ a list of string **member** scores as double-precision floating point numbers.

---

### ZPOPMAX

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZPOPMAX key [count]
```

Removes and returns up to count members with the highest scores in the sorted set stored at **key**.

When left unspecified, the default value for count is 1. Specifying a count value that is higher than the sorted set's cardinality will not produce an error. When returning multiple elements, the one with the highest score will be the first, followed by the elements with lower scores.

---

### ZPOPMIN

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZPOPMIN key [count]
```

Removes and returns up to count members with the lowest scores in the sorted set stored at **key**.

When left unspecified, the default value for count is 1. Specifying a count value that is higher than the sorted set's cardinality will not produce an error. When returning multiple elements, the one with the lowest score will be the first, followed by the elements with greater scores.

---

### ZRANDMEMBER

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZRANDMEMBER key [count [WITHSCORES]]
```

When called with just the key argument, return a random element from the sorted set value stored at **key**.

If the provided count argument is positive, return an array of distinct elements. The array's length is either count or the sorted set's cardinality [ZCARD](#zcard), whichever is lower.

If called with a negative count, the behavior changes and the command is allowed to return the same element multiple times. In this case, the number of returned elements is the absolute value of the specified count.

The optional WITHSCORES modifier changes the reply so it includes the respective scores of the randomly selected elements from the sorted set.

---

### ZRANGE {#zrange}

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZRANGE key start stop [BYSCORE|BYLEX] [REV] [LIMIT offset count] [WITHSCORES]
```

Returns the specified range of elements in the sorted set stored at **key**.

**ZRANGE** can perform different types of range queries: by index (rank), by the score, or by lexicographical order.

---

### ZRANGEBYLEX {#zrangebylex}

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZRANGEBYLEX key min max [LIMIT offset count]
```

When all the elements in a sorted set are inserted with the same score, in order to force lexicographical ordering, this command returns all the elements in the sorted set at **key** with a value between min and max.

If the elements in the sorted set have different scores, the returned elements are unspecified.

It can be replaced by [ZRANGE](#zrange) with the BYLEX argument when migrating from older versions.

---

### ZRANGEBYSCORE {#zrangebyscore}

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZRANGEBYSCORE key min max [WITHSCORES] [LIMIT offset count]
```

Returns all the elements in the sorted set at **key** with a score between min and max (including elements with score equal to min or max). The elements are considered to be ordered from low to high scores.

The elements having the same score are returned in lexicographical order.

It can be replaced by [ZRANGE](#zrange) with the BYSCORE argument when migrating or writing new code.

---

### ZRANK {#zrank}

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZRANK key member [WITHSCORE]
```

Returns the rank of member in the sorted set stored at **key**, with the scores ordered from low to high. The rank (or index) is 0-based, which means that the member with the lowest score has rank 0.

The optional WITHSCORE argument supplements the command's reply with the score of the element returned.

Use [ZREVRANK](#zrevrank) to get the rank of an element with the scores ordered from high to low.

---

### ZREM

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZREM key member [member ...]
```

Removes the specified members from the sorted set stored at **key**. Non existing members are ignored.

---

### ZREMRANGEBYLEX

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZREMRANGEBYLEX key min max
```

When all the elements in a sorted set are inserted with the same score, in order to force lexicographical ordering, this command removes all elements in the sorted set stored at **key** between the lexicographical range specified by min and max.

The meaning of min and max are the same of the [ZRANGEBYLEX](#zrangebylex) command. Similarly, this command actually removes the same elements that [ZRANGEBYLEX](#zrangebylex) would return if called with the same min and max arguments.

---

### ZREMRANGEBYSCORE

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZREMRANGEBYSCORE key min max
```

Removes all elements in the sorted set stored at key with a score between min and max (inclusive).

---

### ZREMRANGEBYRANK

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZREMRANGEBYRANK key start stop
```

Removes all elements in the sorted set stored at **key** with rank between start and stop. Both start and stop are 0 -based indexes with 0 being the element with the lowest score. These indexes can be negative numbers, where they indicate offsets starting at the element with the highest score. For example: -1 is the element with the highest score, -2 the element with the second highest score and so forth.

---

### ZREMRANGEBYSCORE

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZREMRANGEBYSCORE key min max
```

Removes all elements in the sorted set stored at **key** with a score between min and max (inclusive).

---

### ZREVRANGE

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZREVRANGE key start stop [WITHSCORES]
```

Returns the specified range of elements in the sorted set stored at **key**. The elements are considered to be ordered from the highest to the lowest score. Descending lexicographical order is used for elements with equal score.

Apart from the reversed ordering, **ZREVRANGE** is similar to [ZRANGE](#zrange).

---

### ZREVRANK {#zrevrank}

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZREVRANK key member [WITHSCORE]
```

Returns the rank of member in the sorted set stored at **key**, with the scores ordered from high to low. The rank (or index) is 0-based, which means that the member with the highest score has rank 0.

The optional WITHSCORE argument supplements the command's reply with the score of the element returned.

Use [ZRANK](#zrank) to get the rank of an element with the scores ordered from low to high.

---

### ZSCAN {#zscan}

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZSCAN key cursor [MATCH pattern] [COUNT count]
```

Iterates over the elements of a Sorted Set. Same as [HSCAN](#hscan) and [SSCAN](#sscan) commands, **ZSCAN** is used in order to incrementally iterate over the elements of the set stored at **key**.

The **match** parameter allows to apply a filter to elements after they have been retrieved from the collection. The **count** option sets a limit to the maximum number of items returned from the server to this command. This limit is also set in conjunction with the object-scan-count-limit of the global server settings.

---

### ZSCORE

#### Syntax

```bash
    ZSCORE key member
```

Returns the score of member in the sorted set at **key**.

If member does not exist in the sorted set, or **key** does not exist, nil is returned.

---

## Geospatial indices

### GEOADD

#### Syntax

```bash
    GEOADD key [NX | XX] [CH] longitude latitude member [longitude latitude member ... ]
```

Adds the specified geospatial items (longitude, latitude, name) to the specified key. Data is stored into the key as a sorted set, in a way that makes it possible to query the items with the [GEOSEARCH](#geosearch) command.

The command takes arguments in the standard format x,y so the longitude must be specified before the latitude. There are limits to the coordinates that can be indexed: areas very near to the poles are not indexable.

The exact limits, are the following:

* Valid longitudes are from -180 to 180 degrees.
* Valid latitudes are from -85.05112878 to 85.05112878 degrees.

The command will report an error when the user attempts to index coordinates outside the specified ranges.

Note: there is no **GEODEL** command because you can use [ZREM](#zrem) to remove elements. The Geo index structure is a sorted set.

**GEOADD** also provides the following options:

* **XX:** Only update elements that already exist. Never add elements.
* **NX:** Don't update already existing elements. Always add new elements.
* **CH:** Modify the return value from the number of new elements added, to the total number of elements changed (CH is an abbreviation of changed). 

Changed elements are new elements added and elements already existing for which the coordinates was updated. So elements specified in the command line having the same score as they had in the past are not counted. Note: normally, the return value of **GEOADD** only counts the number of new elements added.

Note: The **XX** and **NX** options are mutually exclusive.

---

### GEODIST

#### Syntax

```bash
    GEODIST key member1 member2 [M|KM|FT|MI]
```

Return the distance between two members in the geospatial index represented by the sorted set.

Given a sorted set representing a geospatial index, populated using the GEOADD command, the command returns the distance between the two specified members in the specified unit.

If one or both the members are missing, the command returns NULL.

The unit must be one of the following, and defaults to meters:

* m for meters.
* km for kilometers.
* mi for miles.
* ft for feet.

The distance is computed assuming that the Earth is a perfect sphere, so errors up to 0.5% are possible in edge cases.

### GEOHASH

#### Syntax

```bash
    GEOHASH key [member [member ...]]
```

Return valid Geohash strings representing the position of one or more elements in a sorted set value representing a geospatial index (where elements were added using [GEOADD](#geoadd)).

---

### GEOPOS

#### Syntax

```bash
    GEOPOS key [member [member ...]]
```

Return the positions (longitude,latitude) of all the specified members of the geospatial index represented by the sorted set at key.

Given a sorted set representing a geospatial index, populated using the [GEOADD](#geoadd) command, it is often useful to obtain back the coordinates of specified members. When the geospatial index is populated via [GEOADD](#geoadd) the coordinates are converted into a 52 bit geohash, so the coordinates returned may not be exactly the ones used in order to add the elements, but small errors may be introduced.

The command can accept a variable number of arguments so it always returns an array of positions even when a single element is specified.

### GEOSEARCH

#### Syntax

```bash
    GEOSEARCH key <FROMMEMBER member> <BYBOX width height <M|KM|FT|MI>> [ASC|DESC] [WITHCOORD WITHDIST WITHHASH]
```

Return the members of a sorted set populated with geospatial information using [GEOADD](#geoadd), which are within the borders of the area specified by a given shape.

The query's center point is provided by one of these mandatory options:

* **FROMMEMBER:** Use the position of the given existing *member* in the sorted set.

The query's shape is provided by this option:

* **BYBOX:** Search inside an axis-aligned rectangle, determined by *height* and *width*.

The command optionally returns additional information using the following options:

* **WITHDIST:** Also return the distance of the returned items from the specified center point. The distance is returned in the same unit as specified for the radius or height and width arguments.
* **WITHCOORD:** Also return the longitude and latitude of the matching items.
* **WITHHASH:** Also return the raw geohash-encoded sorted set score of the item, in the form of a 52 bit unsigned integer. This is only useful for low level hacks or debugging and is otherwise of little interest for the general user.

Matching items are returned unsorted by default. To sort them, use one of the following two options:

* **ASC:** Sort returned items from the nearest to the farthest, relative to the center point.

* **DESC:** Sort returned items from the farthest to the nearest, relative to the center point.

**Reply**

An Array reply of matched members, where each sub-array represents a single item, (longitude,latitude).
