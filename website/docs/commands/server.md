### ROLE

#### Syntax

```bash
ROLE
```

Provide information on the role of a Redis instance in the context of replication, by returning if the instance is currently a master, slave, or sentinel. The command also returns additional information about the state of the replication (if the role is master or slave) or the list of monitored master names (if the role is sentinel).

#### Resp Reply

The command returns an array of elements. The elements of the array depends on the role.

## Master output

The master output is composed of the following parts:

1. The string `master`.
2. The current master replication offset, which is an offset that masters and replicas share to understand, in partial resynchronizations, the part of the replication stream the replicas needs to fetch to continue.
3. An array composed of three elements array representing the connected replicas. Every sub-array contains the replica IP, port, and the last acknowledged replication offset.

## Output of the command on replicas

The replica output is composed of the following parts:

1. The string `slave`, because of backward compatibility (see note at the end of this page).
2. The IP of the master.
3. The port number of the master.
4. The state of the replication from the point of view of the master, that can be `connect` (the instance needs to connect to its master), `connecting` (the master-replica connection is in progress), `sync` (the master and replica are trying to perform the synchronization), `connected` (the replica is online).
5. The amount of data received from the replica so far in terms of master replication offset.

---

### MONITOR

#### Syntax

```bash
MONITOR
```

MONITOR is a debugging command that streams back every command processed by the Redis server. It can help in understanding what is happening to the database.

#### Resp Reply

Non-standard return value. Dumps the received commands in an infinite flow.
