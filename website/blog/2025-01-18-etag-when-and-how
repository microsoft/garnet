Garnet recently announced native support for ETag based commands. ETags are a primitive that give users access to sophisticated techniques such as Optimistic Concurrency Control as well as more efficient network bandwidth utilization for caching.

ETags are currently provided over Raw Strings in Garnet.

ETags are available to users without the need of any migration; this means your existing key-value pairs can start using ETags on the fly without affecting existing performance metrics.
You can find the [ETag API documentation here](HK TODO).

This article will help you explore when and how you can use this new shiny Garnet feature for your current and future applications.

1. Reduced network bandwidth utilization for caching.
2. Avoid the cost of transactions for working with non-atomic values in your cache-store

Both the above cases are common cases for folks using Caches, lets go case by case.
