everyone! I just wanted to start off this blog with a short history of Garnet and how it came to exist. At Microsoft Research, we have been working on storage technology for a while. In 2016, we started working on a new key-value store design based on epoch protection and a powerful storage API. This project, called FASTER, was open-sourced in 2018 and gained a lot of traction within Microsoft and in the larger community. FASTER has over 6k stars and over half a million NuGet downloads. Over the next several years, we built follow-on capabilities such as recoverability (CPR) and serverless support (Netherite), and the project was widely adopted. Around 2021, we noticed a huge interest in remote cache-stores, particularly using APIs such as the RESP API of Redis. Developers loved the flexibility of both the API and the deployment model as a separate process/service. The cost savings compared to accessing cloud databases directly drove the adoption of caching layers, and these soon grew to take up a significant portion of the operating cost of large services. When the pandemic hit and online service usage spiked, there was a strong need for lowering costs and improving performance (throughput and latency) for such caching layers. We took on the challenge of building a new system, called Garnet, which could provide extremely high performance end-to-end in a client-server setup while allowing clients to remain largely unmodified by adopting RESP, the most popular wire protocols out there. After a lot of design effort, we came up with a server threading model that could indeed make a huge end-to-end difference, often by orders-of-magnitude, in performance for basic get and set operations, with unmodified client code. This gave us the confidence to build out Garnet's feature set towards use in real scenarios. The next question was API coverage. The Redis API is vast, and we were just a small research team. Thankfully, our stack was built on .NET, which made tremendous advances in both performance and richness of libraries. We designed a generic yet powerful way to define and use custom data structures, and were able to quickly implement complex datatypes such as Sorted Set, List, and Hash by reusing data structures in C#. We then built complex structures such as HyperLogLog and Bitmap as well, and added transactions and extensibility features. The next requirement was scale-out and recovery, for which we designed write-ahead operation logging, sharding capability, replication, and key migration for dynamic scale-out. By keeping basic compatibility with the Redis API, we were able to add these features in a way that existing client code could be largely unchanged. After thousands of unit tests and a couple of years working with first-party teams at Microsoft deploying Garnet in production (more on this in future blog posts!), we felt it was time to release it publicly, just like we did with FASTER five years back. We wanted developers across the planet to benefit from this powerful technology and contribute back to the codebase as well. We felt that the modern C# codebase would be particularly attractive here, in terms of ease of expansion, maintenance, and contribution. Coming from MSR, we also wanted people in academia to conduct research, collaborate with us, and expand various aspects of the system. So, explore Garnet, see if you can find use for it in your applications, consider helping us out with expanding its capabilities, and as always, let us know what you think!","s":"A Brief History of Garnet","u":"/garnet/blog/brief-history","h":"","p":3},{"i":6,"t":"The Microsoft Research Blog has just published a new post introducing Garnet.

Native ETags in a cache-store enable real-world use cases such as maintaining cache consistency, reducing network bandwidth utilization, and avoiding full-blown transactions for several applications. Garnet provides native ETag support for raw strings (data added and retrieved using operations such as GET and SET). It is not available for objects (such as sorted-set, hash, list). This feature is available without requiring any migration, allowing your existing key-value pairs to start leveraging ETags immediately. You can find the ETag API documentation here.

Typically, multiple client applications access the cache and the database at the same time. If every client were to access a different set of keys, the caches can easily be maintained consistenty: a client simply writes to the database and then updates the cache. However, in cases where a key can be updated by multiple clients, the naive approach of first updating the database and then updating the cache can lead to subtle race conditions. Specifically, whichever client writes to the cache last determines the final state of the cache. This cached state may not ever correspond to the final state of the database for the same key! To make the above scenario clearer, consider a cache-database setup where 2 clients are interacting with the pair. They both follow the same protocol where on writes they first update the database, and then update the cache. We will denote each client by c1 and c2, the request to update the datbase as D, and the request to update the cache as C. All is good for sequences where the last writer to the database is also the last writer to the cache: However, if the last writer to the database is NOT the last writer to the case, we introduce a permanent inconsistency between the cache and the database, as the following diagram depicts: In the above sequencing, note that c2 performs the last write to the database. However, c1 performs the last write to the cache. As a result, the cache and the database have gone out of sync. For handling such cases we can rely on the newly introduced ETag feature in Garnet to construct a logical clock around the updates that protect establishing cache consistency (*provided your database also supports ETags or some other form of server-side transactions). In such a scenario the client should use our SETIFGREATER API here, when interacting with the cache. SETIFGREATER sends a key-value pair along with an etag from the client, and only sets the value if the sent ETag is greater than what is currently set in the cache for that key-value pair. Every client would now follow the following protocol: Database stores a pair of (value, etag) on the server Use a transaction (or SETIFGREATER or SETIFMATCH API) on the database to atomically update (oldValue, etag) to (newValue, etag+1), and return the new etag to the client. Use the retrieved ETag from our previous call as an argument for SETIFGREATER to update the cache, so that the cache is updated only if the new tag is greater than what is currently stored in the cache. If every client follows the above protocol. We can ensure that only the last/latest database write will be reflected in the cache, leading to eventual consistency. The same sequencing of events as before, but with the clients following our new updated protocol, is shown below:","s":"Keeping the Cache Consistent with its Back-end Database","u":"/garnet/blog/etags-when-and-how","h":"#keeping-the-cache-consistent-with-its-back-end-database","p":7},{"i":14,"t":"Every network call incurs a cost: the amount of data transmitted and the distance over which it travels. In performance-sensitive scenarios, it's beneficial to fetch data only if it has changed in the cache, thereby reducing bandwidth usage and network latency.","s":"Reducing Network Bandwidth Utilization for Caching","u":"/garnet/blog/etags-when-and-how","h":"#reducing-network-bandwidth-utilization-for-caching","p":7},{"i":16,"t":"Consider the following setup: High-Level Diagram​ Sequence Diagram​ In the absence of ETags, the entire payload for k1 is returned on every read, regardless of whether the value associated with k1 has changed. While this might not matter when transferring small payloads (e.g., 100 bytes of data within a high-bandwidth local network), it becomes significant when you have multiple machines egressing larger payloads (e.g., 1MB each) on a cloud provider. You pay the cost of egress, bandwidth usage, and experience delays due to the transmission of larger amounts of data. To address this, Garnet provides the GETIFNOTMATCH API here. , allowing you to fetch data only if it has changed since your last retrieval. Server 1 can store the ETag received in the initial payload in application memory and use GETIFNOTMATCH to refresh the local copy only if the value has changed. This approach is particularly beneficial in read-heavy systems where data changes infrequently. However, for frequently updated keys, using the regular GET API may still be preferable, as updated data will always need to be transmitted. Take a look at the ETag caching sample to see the usage of the GETIFNOTMATCH API in action.","s":"Scenario: Cache Invalidation","u":"/garnet/blog/etags-when-and-how","h":"#scenario-cache-invalidation","p":7},{"i":18,"t":"Cache-stores such as Garnet rely on key-level (or bucket-level) locks on the server to ensure atomic updates by multiple clients to a key-value pair. We often wish to read a remote value, perform some local computations that update the value, and then write the new value back to the server. Due to the cost of the network round-trip and the potential for clients to crash at any time, holding a server-side lock for such a long duration of time is not possible. ETags offer an alternative to transactions when working with such use cases.","s":"Avoiding Costly Transactions When Working with Non-Atomic Operations","u":"/garnet/blog/etags-when-and-how","h":"#avoiding-costly-transactions-when-working-with-non-atomic-operations","p":7},{"i":20,"t":"Imagine multiple clients concurrently modifying an XML document stored in Garnet. For example: Client 1 reads the XML, updates Field A, and writes it back. Client 2 reads the same XML, updates Field B, and writes it back concurrently. Without ETags, the following sequence of events might occur: Client 1 reads value v0 for key k1. Client 1 modifies Field A, creating a local copy v1. Client 2 reads the same value v0 before Client 1 writes v1. Client 2 modifies Field B, creating another local copy v2. Either Client 1 or Client 2 writes its version back to the server, potentially overwriting the other’s changes since v1 and v2 both don't have either's changes. This race condition results in lost updates. With ETags, you can use the SETIFMATCH API here to implement a compare-and-swap mechanism which guarantees that no updates are lost. Client 1 reads value v0 for key k1. Client 1 modifies Field A, creating a local copy v1. Client 2 reads the same value v0 before Client 1 writes v1. Client 2 modifies Field B, creating another local copy v2. Client 1 does a SETIFMATCH to try and install its update, which succeeds. Client 2 does a SETIFMATCH to try and install its update, which fails as the server's ETag has now changed. Client 2 retries with the updated value, and eventually succeeds in applying its changes to the value. The following code snippets demonstrate how this can be achieved.","s":"Scenario: Concurrent updates to the same Value","u":"/garnet/blog/etags-when-and-how","h":"#scenario-concurrent-updates-to-the-same-value","p":7},{"i":22,"t":"static async Task Client(string userKey) { Random random = new Random(); using var redis = await ConnectionMultiplexer.ConnectAsync(GarnetConnectionStr); var db = redis.GetDatabase(0); // Initially read the latest ETag var res = await EtagAbstractions.GetWithEtag<ContosoUserInfo>(userKey); long etag = res.Item1; ContosoUserInfo userInfo = res.Item2; while (true) { token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested(); (etag, userInfo) = await ETagAbstractions.PerformLockFreeSafeUpdate<ContosoUserInfo>( db, userKey, etag, userInfo, (ContosoUserInfo info) => { info.TooManyCats = info.NumberOfCats % 5 == 0; }); await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(random.Next(0, 15)), token); } } Supporting Methods​ public static async Task<(long, T?)> GetWithEtag<T>(IDatabase db, string key) { var executeResult = await db.ExecuteAsync(\"GETWITHETAG\", key); if (executeResult.IsNull) return (-1, default(T)); RedisResult[] result = (RedisResult[])executeResult!; long etag = (long)result[0]; T item = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<T>((string)result[1]!)!; return (etag, item); } public static async Task<(long, T)> PerformLockFreeSafeUpdate<T>(IDatabase db, string key, long initialEtag, T initialItem, Action<T> updateAction) { // Compare and Swap Updating long etag = initialEtag; T item = initialItem; while (true) { // perform custom action, since item is updated to it's correct latest state by the server this action is performed exactly once on // an item before it is finally updated on the server. // NOTE: Based on your application's needs you can modify this method to update a pure function that returns a copy of the data and does not use mutations as side effects. updateAction(item); var (updatedSuccesful, newEtag, newItem) = await _updateItemIfMatch(db, etag, key, item); etag = newEtag; if (!updatedSuccesful) item = newItem!; else break; } return (etag, item); } private static async Task<(bool updated, long etag, T?)> _updateItemIfMatch<T>(IDatabase db, long etag, string key, T value) { string serializedItem = JsonSerializer.Serialize<T>(value); RedisResult[] res = (RedisResult[])(await db.ExecuteAsync(\"SETIFMATCH\", key, serializedItem, etag))!; // successful update does not return updated value so we can just return what was passed for value. if (res[1].IsNull) return (true, (long)res[0], value); T deserializedItem = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<T>((string)res[1]!)!; return (false, (long)res[0], deserializedItem); } Every read-(extra logic/modify)-write call starts by first reading the latest etag and value for a key using GETWITHETAG here, it then wraps it's update logic in a callback action and then calls the PerformLockFreeSafeUpdate method in ETagAbstractions to safely apply the update. Internally the PerformLockFreeSafeUpdate method runs a loop that retrieves the data that performs your update on the object and sends a SETIFMATCH request, the server only then updates the value if your ETag indicates that at the time of your decision you had performed your update on the latest copy of the data. If the server sees that between your read and write there were any updates the value, the server sends the latest copy of the data along with the updated etag, your client code then reapplies the changes on the latest copy and resends the request back to the server for the update, this form of update will guarantees that eventually all changes synchronize themselves on the server one after other. In a read-heavy system where contention is not high on the same key this update will be performed in the very first loop itself, and be easier to manage than having a custom transaction. However, in a heavy key contention scenario this could result in multiple attempts to write to the latest copy especially if the logic between your read and write is slow. ETags are more of a lower level primitives that you can use to build abstractions that let you build logical clocks, and lock free transactions tailored to your needs. If you find yourself in the above commonly found distributed scenarios, you now have another tool in your toolbag to help overcome your scaling needs.","s":"Example Code","u":"/garnet/blog/etags-when-and-how","h":"#example-code","p":7},{"i":25,"t":"We have evaluated Garnet using a benchmarking client tool we wrote, called Resp.benchmark.

In contrast, our latency experiments were performed on an empty database and for a combined workload of GET/SET commands that operate on a small keyspace (1024 keys). Throughput GET​ For the experiment depicted in Figure 1., we used large batches of GET operations (4096 requests per batch) and small payloads (8-byte keys and values) to minimize network overhead.

Hyperloglog​ Garnet supports its own built-in Hyperloglog (HLL) data structure. This is implemented using C# and it supports operations such as update (PFADD), compute an estimate (PFCOUNT) and merge (PFMERGE) two or more distinct HLL structures. HLL data structures are often optimized in terms of their memory footprint. Our implementation is no different, utilizing a sparse representation when the number of nonzero counts is low and a dense representation beyond a given fixed threshold for which the trade-off between memory savings and the additional work performed for decompression is no longer attractive. Enabling efficient updates to the HyperLogLog (HLL) structure is essential for concurrent systems, such as Garnet. For this reason, our experiments forcus specifically on the performance of PFADD and are deliberately designed to stress test our system for the following scenarios: Large number of high contention updates (i.e. batchsize 4096, DB of 1024 keys) for increasing number of threads or increasing payload size After a few insertions, the constructed HyperLogLog (HLL) structures will transition to utilizing the dense representation. Large number of low contention updates (i.e. batchsize 4096, DB of 256M keys) for increasing number of threads or increasing payload size This adjustment will increase the likelihood that the constructed HyperLogLog (HLL) structures utilize the sparse representation. Consequently, our measurements will consider the added overhead of working with compressed data or incrementally allocating more space for non-zero values In Figure 5, we present the results for first experimental scenario. Garnet scales very well under high contention and consistently outperforms every other system in terms of raw throughput for increasing number of threads. Similarly, for increasing payload size Garnet exhibits higher total throughput compared to other systems. Across all tested systems, we noticed a noticeable decrease in throughput as the payload size increased. This behavior is anticipated due to the inherent TCP network bottleneck.

Figure 6 shows the results for the second experimental scenario as described above. Even while operating on the HLL sparse representation, Garnet performs better that any other system and achieves consistently higher throughput while scaling very well for increasing numbers of client sessions. Similarly, for increasing payload size, Garnet outperforms the competition by scoring overall higher throughput. Notice in both cases the throughput is lower compared to the previous experiment due to the overhead of operating on compressed data.

Note that even for batch size of 4, Garnet's throughput gains are noticeably higher than any other system that we tested. This demonstrates that even for small batch size we still outperform the competing systems. Figure 7: Throughput (log-scale), for increasing batchsize by 64 client sessions on a DB with (a) 1024 keys, (b) 1M keys. Bitmap​ Garnet supports a set of bit-oriented operators on string data types. These operators can be processed in constant time (i.e. GETBIT, SETBIT) or linear time (i.e. BITCOUNT, BITPOS, BITOP). To speedup processing, for the linear time operators, we used hardware and SIMD instructions. Below we present the benchmark results for a subset of these operators, covering both complexity categories. Similarly to before we use a small DB size (1024 keys) to evaluate the performance of each system under high contention while avoiding having all the data resident in CPU cache by increasing the paylaod size (1MB). In Figure 8, we present the performance metrics for GETBIT and SETBIT commands. In both cases, Garnet consistently maintains higher throughput and better scalability as the number of client sessions increase.

Garnet maintains overall higher throughput as the number of client session increases, compared to every other system we tested. It also performs very well under high contention, given that our DB size is relatively small (i.e., only 1024 keys). Figure 9: Throughput (log-scale), varying number of client sessions, for a database size of 1024 keys and 1MB payload.

Garnet is thread-scalable within a single node. It also supports sharded cluster execution, with replication, checkpointing, failover, and transactions. It can operate over main memory as well as tiered storage (such as SSD and Azure Storage). Garnet supports a rich API surface and a powerful extensibility model. Garnet uses Redis' RESP as its primary wire protocol. Thus, one can use Garnet with unmodified Redis clients available in most programming languages, for example, with StackExchange.Redis in C#. Compared to other open-source cache-stores, you get much better performance, latency, extensibility, and durability features. Note that Garnet is a research project from Microsoft Research, and the project should be treated as such. That said, we are a bunch of highly passionate researchers and developers working on it full-time at the moment to make it as stable and efficient as we can. Our goal is to create a vibrant community around Garnet. In fact, Garnet has been of sufficiently high quality that several first-party and platform teams at Microsoft have deployed versions of Garnet internally for many months now. Garnet offers the following key advantages: Orders-of-magnitude better server throughput (ops/sec) with small batches and many client sessions, relative to comparable open-source cache-stores. Extremely low single operation latency (often less than 300 microseconds at the 99.9th percentile) on commodity cloud (Azure) machines with accelerated TCP enabled, on both Windows and Linux. Better scalability as we increase the number of clients, with or without client-side batching. The ability to use all CPU/memory resources of a server machine with a single shared-memory server instance (no intra-node cluster needed). Support for larger-than-memory datasets, spilling to local and cloud storage devices. Database features such as fast checkpointing and recovery, and publish/subscribe. Support for multi-node sharded hash partitioning (Redis \"cluster\" mode), state migration, and replication. Well tested with a comprehensive test suite (thousands of unit tests across Garnet and its storage layer Tsavorite). A C# codebase that is easy to evolve and extend.

This allows the replica to be exact copies of the primary. Replication can be leveraged to scale reads and mitigate the effects of primary failures by promoting replicas to primary.

Primaries utilize the Append-Only-File (AOF) to record insert/update operations. A dedicated background task iterates through the log pages and transmits them in bulk to the corresponding replica. Replicas will iterate through the received log pages, replay all insert/update operations in order, and generate their own AOF. Primaries are generally free to take arbitrary checkpoints. When the primary takes a checkpoint, it will insert a checkpoint marker into the AOF. As a side effect of this, when any of the attached replicas receive the corresponding records, it will initiate its own checkpoint. For this reason, an exact version of the data is identified from the following triplet: [replication-id, checkpoint-version, replication-offset] Allowing replicas to take their own checkpoints speeds up the recovery process because in the common case replicas can recover from their own checkpoint and replay their AOF before connecting to their primary and resuming synchronization. On rare occasions, the replica must perform a full synchronization by retrieving the latest checkpoint from the primary. Partial synchronization involves recovering from a local checkpoint (if any) and replaying only the primary's AOF log after the corresponding Checkpoint Covered Replication Offset (CCRO). Full synchronization involves retrieving the latest primary checkpoint and recovering from it before starting to accept any new AOF log records. The replica decides if it will perform either type of synchronization as follows: If the primary replication-id differs from the replica replication-id, a full synchronization must occur. If the primary checkpoint version differs from the replica checkpoint, a full synchronization must occur. If none of the above conditions are true, replica can recover from local checkpoint and then continue replaying from the AOF offsets that is missing.","s":"Garnet Replication Properties","u":"/garnet/docs/cluster/replication","h":"","p":89},{"i":94,"t":"Under normal workload the AOF log will keep growing with every insert/update operation until a checkpoint is taken. Newly added AOF log records will initially reside in memory and then flushed to disk as new records are being added. For write heavye workloads, this could severely impact query performance at the primary. In addition, newly configured replicas, added to the cluster, could face longer synchronization times since they have to replay the AOF log records starting from the corresponding CCRO. The cluster operator can choose between various replication options to achieve a trade-off between performance and durability. A summary of these options is shown below: Fast AOF Truncation (FAT) This option forces the primary to aggressively truncate the AOF so it does not spill into disk. It can be used in combination with aof-memory option which determines the maximum AOF memory buffer size. When a replica attaches to a primary with FAT turned on, the AOF is not guaranteed to be truncated which may result in writes being lost. To overcome this issue FAT should be used with ODC. On Demand Checkpoint (ODC) This option forces the primary to take a checkpoint if no checkpoint is available when replica tries to attach and recover. If a checkpoint becomes or was availalbe and the CCRO has not been truncated, then the primary will lock it to prevent truncation while a replica is recovering. In this case, they AOF log could spill to disk as the AOF in memory buffer becomes full. Under normal operation, the AOF is truncated and no spilling to disk will happen. Using the aforementioned options, we guarantee that no writes are lost while a replica is attaching and replication remains highly performant. However, due to the asynchronous nature of replication, if a primary goes down before unexpectedly, the replicas might have not received the latest AOF log records, resulting in lost writes.","s":"Replication Performance vs Durability Options","u":"/garnet/docs/cluster/replication","h":"#replication-performance-vs-durability-options","p":89},{"i":96,"t":"The process of setting up a cluster with replication is similar to setting up a regular cluster while also enabling the aof option.

By default every Garnet instance will take the role of an empty primary. The cluster operator has to initially assign the slots to a subset of those primaries.

This operation can be expensive because it involves multiple I/O operations at the primary and replica. For this reason, we added a variant of full synchronization called diskless replication. This is implemented using a streaming checkpoint that allows clients to continue issuing read and writes at the primary while attaching replicas synchronize. To enable diskless replication the server needs to be started with the following flags --repl-diskless-sync=true This is used to enable diskless replication --repl-diskless-sync-delay=<seconds>. This is used to determine how many seconds to wait before starting the full sync, in order to give the opportunity to multiple replicas to attach and receive the streaming checkpoint. There is no additional requirements to that of using the aforementioned flags in order to leverage diskless replication. The APIs for mapping replicas remain the same (i.e. CLUSTER REPLICATE, REPLICAOF etc.). Note that diskless replication does not take an actual checkpoint. Hence every time a full sync is performed, the AOF is not automatically truncated (unless FAT flag is used). This happens to ensure durability in the event of a failure which will not be possible if the AOF gets truncated without a persistent checkpoint. However, the store version gets incremented to ensure consistency across different instances that may be fully synced at different times.

The cluster operator can use this command in combination with MIGRATE, COUNTKEYSINSLOT, and GETKEYSINSLOT to transfer slot ownership between nodes in the cluster. The following options are available: MIGRATING​ The slot state is set to MIGRATING, if and only if the receiving node is the primary owner of the slot the slot is not already in migrating state the specifief node-id is known and it corresponds to a primary node. Due to the aforementioned conditions, slots can transition to MIGRATING state only at the source node. Therefore, any queries on keys associated to a slot that is in MIGRATING state, will be processed at the source node as follows: Read commands are processed as usual if key exists otherwise they are redirected to target node using -MOVED response. Write requests for existing keys are declined using -MIGRATING response otherwise they are redirected to the target node using -ASK response. NOTE: This state change is transient so it will not be propagated through gossip to rest of cluster nodes. However, -MOVED redirection will still be emitted pointing to the source node of the slot. IMPORTING​ The slot state is set to IMPORTING, if and only if The receiving node is a primary that does not already own the slot.

This copy maintains information about the known cluster workers and the related slot assignment. Both pieces of information are represented using an array of structs as shown below. Changes to the local copy are communicated to the rest of the cluster nodes through gossiping. Note that information related to the node characteristics can be updated only by the node itself by issuing the relevant cluster commands. For example, a node cannot become a REPLICA by receiving a gossip message. It can only change its current role only after receiving a CLUSTER REPLICATE request. We follow this constrain to avoid having to deal with cluster misconfiguration in the event of network partitions. This convention also extends to slot assignment, which is managed through direct requests to cluster instances made using the CLUSTER [ADDSLOTS|DELSLOTS] and CLUSTER [ADDSLOTSRANGE|DELSLOTSRANGE] commands. Hashlot & Worker Array Declaration loading... View on GitHub Initially, the cluster nodes are empty, taking the role of a PRIMARY, having no assigned slots and with no knowledge of any other node in the cluster. The local node contains information only about itself stored at workers[1] while workers[0] is reserved for special use to indicate unassigned slots. Garnet cluster nodes are connected to each other through the CLUSTER MEET command which generates a special kind of gossip message. This message forces a remote node to add the sender to its list of trusted nodes. Remote nodes are stored in any order starting from workers[2]. Worker Definition loading... View on GitHub Information about the individual slot assignment is captured within the configuration object using an array of HashSlot struct type. It maintains information about the slot state and corresponding owner. The slot owner is represented using the offset in the local copy of the workers array. The slot state is used to determine how to serve requests for keys that map to the relevant slot. HashSlot Definition loading... View on GitHub At cluster startup slots are are unassigned, hence their initial state is set to OFFLINE and workerId to 0. When a slot is assigned to a specific node, its state is set to STABLE and workerId (from the perspective of the local configuration copy) to the corresponding offset of the owner node in workers array. Owners of a slot can perform read/write and migrate operations on the data associated with that specific slot. Replicas can serve read requests only for keys mapped to slots owned by their primary.

The gossip message will contain a serialized byte array representation which represents a snapshot of the remote node's local configuration. The receiving node will try to atomically merge the incoming configuration to its local copy by comparing the relevant workers' configuration epoch. Hence any changes to the cluster's configuration can happen at the granularity of a single worker. We leverage this mechanism to control when local updates become visiable to the rest of the cluster. This is extremely useful for operations that are extended over a long duration and consist of several phases (e.g. data migration). Such operations are susceptible to interruptions and require protective measures to prevent any compromise of data integrity. As mentioned previously, local updates are propagated through gossiping which can operate in broadcast mode or gossip sampling mode. In the former case, we broadcast the configuration to all nodes in the cluster periodically, while in the latter case we pick randomly a subset of nodes to gossip with.

Slot verification involves inspecting the key or keys associated with a given command and validating that it maps to a slot that can be served by the node receiving the associated request. Garnet primary nodes can serve read and read-write requests for slots that they own, while Garnet replica nodes can only serve read requests for slots that their primary owns.

In the table below, we provide a summary of the different redirection messages that are generated depending on the slot state and the type of operation being performed. Read-only and read-write requests for a specific key mapping to a REMOTE slot will result in -MOVED <slot> <address>:<port> redirection message, pointing to the endpoint that claims ownership of the associated slot. A slot can also be in a special state such as IMPORTING or MIGRATING. These states are used primarily during slot migration, with the IMPORTING state assigned to the slot map of the target node and the MIGRATING state to the slot map of the source node. Should a slot be in the MIGRATING state and the key is present (meaning it has not yet been migrated), the read requests can continue to be processed as usual. Otherwise the receiving node (for both read-only and read-write requests) will return -ASK <slot> <address>:<port> redirection message pointing to the target node.

This operation allows for efficient resource utilization and load balancing across the cluster when adding or removing nodes. The migration operation is only available in cluster mode. Slot migration can be initiated by the owner (referred to as the source node) of a given slot, and addressed towards another already known, and trusted primary node (referred to as the target node). Actual data migration can be initiated by using the MIGRATE command that operates in two modes: (1) Migrate individual keys (2) Migrate entire slots or range of slots.

Validation involves the following: Parse every migration option and validate arguments associated with that option. Validate ownership of associated slot that is about to be migrated. For KEYS option, validate that keys to be migrated do not hash across different slots. For SLOTS/SLOTSRANGE option, validate no slot is referenced multiple times. For SLOTSRANGE option, make sure a range is defined by a pair of values. Validate that the target of the migration is known, trusted and has the role of a primary. When parsing completes succesfully, a migration session is created and executed. Depending on the chosen option, the migration session executes either as a foreground task (using KEYS option) or a background task (SLOTS/SLOTSRANGE option). The second component is separated into the following sub-components: MigrationManager MigrateSessionTaskStore MigrateSession The MigrationManager is responsible for managing the active MigrateSession tasks. It uses the MigrateSessionTaskStore to atomically add or remove new instances of MigrateSession. It is also responsible for ensuring that existing sessions do not conflict with sessions that are about to be added, by checking if the referred slots in each session do not conflict. Finally, it provideds information on the number of ongoing migrate tasks.","s":"Implementation Details","u":"/garnet/docs/dev/cluster/slot-migration","h":"","p":777},{"i":782,"t":"Since slot migration can be initiated while a Garnet cluster is operational, it needs to be carefully orchestrated to avoid any data integrity issues when clients attempt to write new data. In addition, whatever solution is put forth should not hinder data avaibility while migration is in progress. Our implementation leverages on the concept of slot-based sharding to ensure that keys mapping to the related slot cannot be modified while a migrate task is active. This is achieved by setting the slot state to MIGRATING in the source node. This prevents any write requests though it still allows for reads. Write requests can be issued towards the target node using ASKING, though there are not consistency guarantees from Garnet if this option is used. Garnet guarantees that no keys can be lost during regular migration (i.e. with using ASKING). Because Garnet operates in a multi-threaded environment, the transition from STABLE to MIGRATING needs to happen safely, so every thread has a chance to observe that state change. This can happen using epoch protection. Specifically, when a slot transitions to a new state, the segment that implements the actual state transition will have to spin-wait after making the change and return only after all active client sessions have moved to the next epoch. An excerpt of the code related to epoch protection during slot state transition is shown below. Every client session, before processing an incoming packet, will first acquire the current epoch. This also happens for the client session that issues a slot state transition command (i.e. CLUSTER SETSLOT). On success of updating the local config command, the processing thread of the previous command will perform the following: release the current epoch (in order to avoid waiting for itselft to transition). spin-wait until all thread transition to next epoch. re-acquire the next epoch. This series of steps ensures that on return, the processing thread guarantees to the command issuer (or the method caller if state transition happens internally), that the state transition is visible to all threads that were active. Therefore, any active client session will process subsequent commands considering the new slot state. Wait for Config loading... View on GitHub During migration, the change in slot state (i.e., MIGRATING) is transient from the perspective of the source node. This means that until migration completes the slot is still owned by the source node. However, because it is necessary to produce -ASK redirect messages, the workerId is set to the workerId of the target node, without bumping the current local epoch (to avoid propagation of this transient update to the whole cluster). Therefore, depending on the context of the operation being executed, the actual owner of the node can be determined by accessing workerId property, while the target node for migration is determined through _workerId variable. For example, the CLUSTER NODES will use workerId property (through GetSlotRange(workerId)) since it has to return actual owner of the node even during migration. At the same, time it needs to return all nodes that are in MIGRATING or IMPORTING state and the node-id associated with that state which can be done by inspecting the _workerId variable (through GetSpecialStates(workerId)).

When using this option, the issuer of the migration command will have to make sure that the slot state is set appropriately in the source, and target node. In addition, the issuer has to provide all keys that map to a specific slot either in one call to MIGRATE or across multiple call before the migration completes. When all key-value pairs have migrated to the target node, the issuer has to reset the slot state and assign ownership of the slot to the new node. MigrateKeys is the main driver for the migration operation using the KEYS option. This method iterates over the list of provided keys and sends them over to the target node. This occurs in the following two phases: find all keys provided by MIGRATE command and send them over to the target node. for all remaining keys not found in the main store, lookup into the object store, and if they are found send them over to the target node. It is possible that a given key cannot be retrieved from either store, because it might have expired. In that case, execution proceeds to the next available key and no specific error is raised. When data transmission completes, and depending if COPY option is enabled, MigrateKeys deletes the keys from the both stores. MigrateKeys Main Method loading...

These options differ from the KEYS options in the following ways: There is no need to have specific knowledge of the individual keys that are being migrated and how they map to the associated slots. The user simply needs to provide just a slot number. State transitions are handled entirely on the server side. For the migration operation to complete, we have to scan both main and object stores to find and migrate all keys associated with a given slot. It might seem, based on the last bullet point from above that the migration operation using SLOTS or SLOTSRANGE is more expensive, especially if the slot that is being migrated contains only a few keys. However, it is generally less expensive compared to the KEYS option which requires multiple roundtrips between client and server (so any relevant keys can be used as input to the MIGRATE command), in addition to having to perform a full scan of both stores. As shown in the code excerpt below, the MIGRATE SLOTS task will safely transition the state of a slot in the remote node config to IMPORTING and the slot state of the local node config to MIGRATING, by relying on the epoch protection mechanism as described previously. Following, it will start migrating the data to the target node in batches. On completion of data migration, the task will conclude with performing next slot state transition where ownership of the slots being migrates will be handed to the target node. The slot ownership exchange becomes visible to the whole cluster by bumping the local node's configuration epoch (i.e. using RelinquishOwnership command). Finally, the source node will issue CLUSTER SETSLOT NODE to the target node to explicitly make it an owner of the corresponding slot collection. This last step is not necessary and it is used only to speed up the config propagation. MigrateSlots Background Task loading...

The command handler awaits on one of two occurrences: A semaphore signal coming from the main loop to notify an item has been found. A timeout specified by the client has been reached.

Main broker loop:​ The main loop (CollectionItemBroker.Start) continuously listens on an AsyncQueue for new incoming events and synchronously calls HandleBrokerEvent for each new event.\\ For events of type NewObserverEvent, InitializeObserver is called. InitializeObserver takes an array of keys and checks the collection values for available item in the order in which they where specified by the client. If an item is found, the observer is updated which sets the result and signals the semaphore to release the awaiting thread. If no item is found, the observer is being added to each key's observer queue. For events of type CollectionUpdatedEvent, TryAssignItemFromKey is called. This method gets the key's observer queue and tries to assign the next available item from the collection stored at key to the next observer. If an available item was indeed found, the observer is updated which sets the result and signals the semaphore to release the awaiting thread. Disposed sessions:​ If a RespServerSession that has an active observer is disposed, its Dispose method will call CollectionItemBroker.HandleSessionDisposed, which in turn will update the observer and signal the semaphore awaiter to stop.

Add a new method to the RespServerSession class. This method will parse the command from the network buffer, call the storage layer API (method declared in step #3) and write the RESP formatted response back to the network buffer (note that the RespServerSession class is divided across several .cs files, object-specific commands will reside under Garnet.server/Resp/Objects/[ObjectName]Commands.cs, while others will reside under Garnet.server/Resp/[Admin|Array|Basic|etc...]Commands.cs, depending on the command type). Back in Garnet.server/Resp/RespCommand.cs, add the new command case to the ProcessBasicCommands or ProcessArrayCommands method respectively, calling the method that was added in step #4.

To implement the storage-level logic of the new command, follow these guidelines according to the new command type: Single-key object store command: If you are adding a command that operates on a single object, the implementation of this method will simply be a call [Read|RMW]ObjectStoreOperation[WithOutput], which in turn will call the Operate method in Garnet.server/Objects/[ObjectName]/[ObjectName]Object.cs, where you will have to add a new case for the command and and the object-specific command implementation in Garnet.server/Objects/[ObjectName]/[ObjectName]ObjectImpl.cs Multi-key object store command: If you are adding a command that operates on multiple objects, you may need to create a transaction in which you will appropriately lock the keys (using the TransactionManager instance). You can then operate on multiple objects (for instance using the GET & SET operations). Main-store command: If you are adding a command that operates on the main store, you'll need to call Tsavorite's Read or RMW methods.

ProcessBasicCommands This includes commands like GET, SET, DEL, RENAME, EXISTS, EXPIRE, TTL, INCR, PING, MULTI, EXEC, QUIT, etc. ProcessArrayCommands If it is not one of the basic commands above, further parsing is performed to check if the incoming data matches any of the array commands - commands related to multiple keys, commands that operate using Object store, etc. like MGET, MSET, KEYS, SCAN, ZADD, ZREM, LPUSH, HSET, etc. ProcessOtherCommands This caters to processing rest of the commands including ProcessAdminCommands (for commands like AUTH, CONFIG, CLUSTER, etc), custom commands, custom transactions, etc. This method also tracks session level metrics like the number of read, write and total commands that have been processed. Transaction related operations are also performed here like calls to skip, start, stop and process commands within. See transactions page for more details.

It (through base class TcpNetworkHandlerBase) registers RecvEventArg_Completed as the callback method to receive data from the socket. Also, validates SSL connection by performing client server authentication using SslStream.AuthenticateAsServerAsync method, depending on whether TLS encryption is enabled. The base class NetworkHandler provides functionality for handling network communication, including sending and receiving data over a network connection. The main parts of the class: The class' constructor initializes various fields and properties, including the server hook, network sender, network buffer pool, TLS-related fields, and logger. It also sets up the network and transport receive buffers based on whether TLS is enabled or not. The Start and StartAsync methods are used to begin the network handler, including the authentication phase if TLS is enabled. These methods take optional parameters such as TLS options and remote endpoint name. They internally call the AuthenticateAsServerAsync or AuthenticateAsClientAsync methods to perform authentication. The AuthenticateAsServerAsync and AuthenticateAsClientAsync methods handle authentication process for TLS connections. They use the sslStream object to perform the authentication and establish a secure connection. These methods also handle reading any extra bytes left over after authentication. The OnNetworkReceive method is called when data is received from the network. This method is responsible for processing the received data. It first checks the status of the TLS reader and performs the necessary transformations on the network and transport receive buffers. Then, it calls the Process method to handle the received data. The Process method is responsible for processing the received data. It checks if there is any data in the transport receive buffer and if there is a message consumer available. If so, it tries to process the request by calling the TryProcessRequest method. The message consumer is responsible for retrieving the session provider based on the wire protocol - ASCII is the only format supported currently. The session provider is previously registered when the Garnet server is initialized. The retrieved session provider is then used to create a new session object, if one doesn't exist already.

As a user, you can use Epoch protection to confidently see the latest state of shared variables without worrying about changes to their state. The overall epoch system proceeds with updating the state only when the thread is done viewing the version of the state. LightEpoch is used because it can run certain operations after other threads that have seen the previous state are no longer executing (that is the basis of epoch control). It's not really \"mutual exclusion\". It's more like setting address boundaries and operating in them in such a way that there is no conflict. Really briefly: threads \"protect\" the current epoch by saying \"I am active in this epoch\" (where \"epoch\" is a counter). When they are done, they remove that protection. When some operation that would change shared variables (like 'HeadAddress') is going to run, it is done by \"bumping\" the epoch, which increases the counter then waits until no other thread is operating with the previous value protected. Variables are set before the bump so that any thread seeing the new counter value also sees the updated variables (again, e.g., 'HeadAddress') so we know that we are safe to operate up to the current 'HeadAddress', which is past the previous one.","s":"Epoch Protection (10,000-foot view)","u":"/garnet/docs/dev/tsavorite/epoch","h":"#epoch-protection-10000-foot-view","p":900},{"i":906,"t":"There is a system-wide LightEpoch threads array with N entries, where N = max(128, ProcessorCount * 2).

This optimization is for cache line sizes on modern processors and L1-L3 caches (64-byte cache line size). When a thread becomes part of the Epoch Protection system, we add it to the epoch table and store a thread-local epoch for that thread in the Epoch Table. At the start of being added to the Epoch Table, the thread-local epoch is set to the current global epoch. Each time we \"acquire\" an epoch, a thread will claim ownership over an epoch counter. Any new incoming threads will take over the epochs only after this one. Each thread that has access to the LightEpoch object can bump the global Epoch (global to the scope of the instance of the LightEpoch class, shared across threads). We can add trigger actions that are executed when all threads are past a safe epoch (For every thread T: SafeEpoch <= thread local Epoch <= Global Epoch). Since the system holds all thread local epochs in a system accesible epoch table we can scan and find a safe epoch. This gives us the ability to have an exactly-once invoked function that depends on all threads logically coordinating and not having any code being executed at the time of Epoch ending for the trigger. If you look closely, what epoch.Resume() essentially does is have a thread find a free entry in the epoch table, put its id there, and \"claim\" the current epoch (the next thread will increment the epoch by 1 and claim the next epoch). Inside epoch.Resume(), there is a loop; if the current target epoch entry is already occupied by another thread, the current thread will yield. When it wakes up, it will try to occupy the next entry.

Tsavorite does not try to lock during individual operations on these session contexts. Transient: Tsavorite acquires and releases locks for individual keys for the duration of a data operation: Upsert, RMW, Read, or Delete. Collectively, these are referred to here as InternalXxx for the internal methods that implement them. None: No locking is done by Tsavorite. All locks are obtained via spinning on Interlocked.CompareExchange and Thread.Yield() and have limited spin count, to avoid deadlocks; if they fail to acquire the desired lock in this time, the operation retries. As noted above, manual locking is done by obtaining the Lockable*Context instance from a ClientSession. There are currently 4 *Context implementations; all are struct for inlining. All *Context are obtained as properties on the ClientSession named for the type (e.g. clientSession.LockableContext). The characteristics of each *Context are: BasicContext: This is exactly the same as ClientSession, internally calling directly through to ClientSession's methods and reusing ClientSession's TsavoriteSession.

UnsafeContext : IUnsafeContext: This provides Transient locking, but rather than safe epoch management handled per-operation by Tsavorite, this supports \"unsafe\" manual epoch management controlled by the client via BeginUnsafe() and EndUnsafe(); it is the client's responsibility to make these calls correctly. UnsafeContext API methods call the internal ContextRead etc. methods without doing the Resume and Suspend (within try/finally) of epoch protection as is done by the \"Safe\" API methods. LockableContext : ILockableContext: This provides safe epoch management, but rather than Transient locking, this requires Manual locks via BeginLockable and EndLockable. This requirement ensures that all locks are acquired before any methods accessing those keys are called. LockableUnsafeContext : ILockableContext, IUnsafeContext: This combines manual epoch management and manual locking, exposing both sets of methods. In addition to the Lock methods, Tsavorite supports: TryLock: Accepts an array of keys and returns true if all locks were acquired, else false (and any locks that were acquired are released) TryPromoteLock: Accepts a single key and returns true if the key's lock could be promoted from Read to Exclusive.","s":"Locking","u":"/garnet/docs/dev/tsavorite/locking","h":"","p":909},{"i":912,"t":"All manual locking of keys must lock the keys in a deterministic order, and unlock in the reverse order, to avoid deadlocks.

These variables are placed within structs that live on the stack at the InternalXxx level. HashEntryInfo​ This is used for hash-chain traversal and CAS updates. It consists primarily of: The key's hash code and associated tag. a stable copy of the HashBucketEntry at the time the HashEntryInfo was populated. This has both Address (which may or may not include the readcache bit) and AbsoluteAddress (Address stripped of the readcache bit) accessors. a pointer (in the unsafe \"C/C++ *\" sense) to the live HashBucketEntry that may be updated by other sessions as our current operation proceeds.

A method to update the stable copy of the HashBucketEntry with the current information from the 'live' pointer. RecordSource​ This is implemented as RecordSource<TKey, TValue> and carries the information identifying the source record and lock information for that record: Whether there is an in-memory source record, and if so: its logical and physical addresses whether it is in the readcache or main log whether it is locked The latest logical address of this key hash in the main log. If there are no readcache records, then this is the same as the HashEntryInfo Address; If there are readcache records in the chain, then RecordSource contains the lowest readcache logical and physical addresses. These are used for 'splicing' a new main-log record into the gap between the readcache records and the main log recoreds; see ReadCache below.

It contains: The HashEntryInfo and RecordSource<TKey, TValue> for this operation. These are generally used together, and in some situations, such as when hlog.HeadAddress has changed due to an epoch refresh, RecordSource<TKey, TValue> is reinitialized from HashEntryInfo during the operation. the logical address of a new record created for the operation. This is passed back up the chain so the try/finally can set it invalid and non-tentative on exceptions, without having to pay the cost of a nested try/finally in the CreateNewRecord* method.","s":"Operation Data Structures","u":"/garnet/docs/dev/tsavorite/locking","h":"#operation-data-structures","p":909},{"i":920,"t":"This section discusses where locks are actually stored. LockTable​ For HashTable locking, the key is hashed to its code which is modulo'd to find the hash table bucket index. This bucket consists of a vector of 8 HashBucketEntries (cache-aligned, as each HashBucketEntry contains only a 'long'). The entries are organized by 'tags', which are the upper 14 bits of the hashcode. The 8th HashBucketEntry is used as a linked list to an overflow bucket; its Address property is a separate allocation that points to an overflow bucket. Thus, a bucket contains 7 entries and a pointer to another bucket if more than 7 tags have been found. Following is a simplified overfire of the 'tag' logic, using FindOrCreateTag as an example: Iterate the first 7 entries of all buckets, including overflow. If the tag is found, use that entry. Otherwise, if an empty entry was found, assign this tag to the first empty entry and use that entry. otherwise, add an overflow bucket and repeat the first two steps in that bucket. (FindTag is simpler, since it does not have to add an entry; it returns false if the tag is not found). For the first bucket, the tag bits of its overflow entry are used for locking; see the HashBucket class for detailed comments. There are 16 tag bits; for locking, 15 bits are used for shared (Read) locking and one bit for exclusive locking. Thus, a key is locked indirectly, by having its HashBucket locked. This may result in multiple keys being locked (all keys that hash to that bucket) rather than just the required key. RecordInfo​ Some relevant RecordInfo bits: Sealed: A record marked Sealed has been superseded by an update (and the record may be in the Revivification FreeList). Sealing is necessary because otherwise one thread could do an RCU (Read, Copy, Update) with a value too large to be an IPU (In-Place Update), while at the same time another thread could do an IPU with a value small enough to fit. A thread encountering a Sealed record should immediately return RETRY_LATER (it must be RETRY_LATER instead of RETRY_NOW, because the thread owning the Seal must do another operation, such as an Insert to tail, to bring things into a consistent state; this operation may require epoch refresh). Sealing is done via RecordInfo.Seal. This is only done when the LockTable entry is already exclusively locked, so Seal() does a simple bitwise operation. Invalid: This indicates that the record is to be skipped, using its .PreviousAddress to move along the chain, rather than restarted. This \"skipping\" semantic is primarily relevant to the readcache; we should not have invalid records in the main log's hash chain. Indeed, any main-log record that is not in the hash chain must be marked Invalid. In the ReadCache we do not Seal records; the semantics of Seal are that the operation is restarted when a Sealed record is found. For non-readcache records, this causes the execution to restart at the tail of the main-log records. However, readcache records are at the beginning of the hash chain, before the main-log records; thus, restarting would start again at the hash bucket, traverse the readcache records, and hit the Sealed record again, ad infinitum. Thus, we instead set readcache records to Invalid when they are no longer current; this allows the traversal to continue until the readcache chain links to the first main-log record. Additionally, records may be elided (removed) from the tag chain for one of the following reasons: The record was deleted The record was a \"source\" for RCU In these cases, if the record's PreviousAddress points below hlog.BeginAddress, we remove the record so we do not have to waste an IO to determine that it is a superseded record. Such elided records are put into the FreeList if it is enabled for Revivification.","s":"Lock Locations","u":"/garnet/docs/dev/tsavorite/locking","h":"#lock-locations","p":909},{"i":922,"t":"When Internalxxx when ConcurrencyControlMode is LockTable: We obtain the key hash at the start of the operation, so we lock its bucket if we are not in a Lockable*Context (if we are, we later Assert that the key is already locked). Following this, the requested operation is performed within a try/finally block whose 'finally' releases the lock. For RCU-like operations such as RMW or Upsert of an in-memory (including in-ReadCache) record, the source record is sealed (and may invalidate it to allow it to be freelisted for Revivification). Similar locking logic applies to the pending IO completion routines: ContinuePendingRead, ContinuePendingRMW, and ContinuePendingConditionalCopyToTail.","s":"Locking Flow","u":"/garnet/docs/dev/tsavorite/locking","h":"#locking-flow","p":909},{"i":924,"t":"The readcache is a cache for records that are read from disk. In the case of record that become 'hot' (read multiple times) this saves multiple IOs. It is of fixed size determined at TsavoriteKV startup, and has no on-disk component; records in the ReadCache are evicted from the head without writing to disk when enough new records are added to the tail to exceed the memory-size specification. When the ReadCache is enabled, records from the ReadCache are inserted into the tag chain starting at the HashBucketEntry (these records are identified as ReadCache by a combination of TsavoriteKV.UseReadCache being set and the ReadCache bit in the RecordInfo is set). All ReadCache records come before any main log record. So (using r#### to indicate a ReadCache record and m#### to indicate a main log record): When there are no ReadCache entries in a hash chain, it looks like: HashTable -> m4000 -> m3000 -> m... When there are ReadCache entries in a hash chain, it looks like: HashTable -> r8000 -> r7000 -> m4000 -> m3000 -> m... As a terminology note, the sub-chain of r#### records is referred to as the ReadCache prefix chain of that hash chain. If the key is found in the readcache, then the RecordSource<TKey, TValue>.Log is set to the readcache, and the logicalAddress is set to the readcache record's logicalAddress (which has the ReadCache bit). If the operation is a successful update (which will always be an RCU; readcache records are never themselves updated), the following steps happen: The new version of the record is \"spliced in\" to the tag chain after the readcache prefix The readcache \"source\" record is invalidated. Using the above example and assuming an update of r8000, the resulting chain would be: HashTable -> r8000 (invalid) -> r7000 -> mxxxx (new) -> m4000 -> m3000 -> m... In this example, note that the record address spaces are totally different between the main log and readcache; \"xxxx\" is used as the \"new address\" to symbolize this. This splicing operation requires that we deal with updates at the tail of the tag chain (in the HashEntryInfo) as well as at the splice point. This cannot be done as a single atomic operation. To handle this, we detach the readcache prefix chain, insert the new record at the tail, and then reattach the detached records. See DetachAndReattachReadCacheChain for specifics. We may fail the reattach, but this is acceptable (versus more complicated and expensive locking) because such failures should be rare and the readcache is just a performance optimization.","s":"ReadCache","u":"/garnet/docs/dev/tsavorite/locking","h":"#readcache","p":909},{"i":926,"t":"Revivification in Tsavorite refers to reusing (\"revivifying\") Tombstoned (deleted) records, as well as in-memory source records for RCUs done by Upsert or RMW. This minimizes log growth (and unused space) for high-delete scenarios. It is used in the following cases: An Upsert, RMW, or Delete that adds a new record CopyToTail from Read or RMW that did IO (or a read from the immutable region of the log that is copied to tail) Revivification is not used for the ReadCache There are two forms of revivification: In-Chain: Tombstoned records are left in the hash chain. A subsequent Upsert or RMW of the same key will revivify the record if it has sufficient value length. FreeList: A free list is maintained, and records that are Tombstoned and are at the tail of the hash chain (pointed to directly from the hash table) are removed from the hash chain and kept in a free list (a binned (by power of 2, by default), multiple-segment-per-bin set of circular buffers). These are separate from the reuse of a record due to a RETRY return from CreateNewRecordXxx. In that case the record address is stored in the PendingContext and CreateNewRecordXxx returns either RETRY_LATER or RETRY_NOW; when the CreateNewRecordXxx is attempted again, it will retrieve this record (if the length is still sufficient and it has not fallen below the minimal required address).

FreeListBins: If this array of RevivificationBin is non-null, then revivification will include a freelist of records, as defined below. SearchNextHigherBin: By default, when looking for FreeRecords we search only the bin for the specified size. If this is set, then if there are no records in the initial bin, then next-higher bin is search as well. RevivifiableFraction: It may be desirable not to use a record that is too close to the ReadOnlyAddress; some apps will prefer that a newly-inserted record remain in the mutable region as long as possible. RevivifiableFraction limits the eligible range of revivification to be within this fraction of memory immediately belowthe TailAddress; it has the same semantics as LogSettings.MutablePercent, and cannot be greater than that. For example, if RevivifiableFraction is .2, TailAddress is 100,000, and HeadAddress is 50,000, then the .2 x 50,000 = 10,000 records closest to the tail will be eligible for reuse. This is done on an address-space basis, not record count, so the actual number of records that can be revivified will vary for variable-length records. RestoreDeletedRecordsIfBinIsFull Deleted records that are to be added to a RevivificationBin are elided from the hash chain. If the bin is full, this option controls whether the record is restored (if possible) to the hash chain. This preserves them as in-chain revivifiable records, at the potential cost of having the record evicted to disk while part of the hash chain, and thus having to do an I/O only to find that the record is deleted and thus potentially unnecessary. For applications that add and delete the same keys repeatedly, this option should be set true if the FreeList is used. UseFreeRecordPoolForCopyToTail When doing explicit CopyToTail operations such as Compaction, CopyToTail when reading from the immutable in-memory region, or disk IO, this controls whether the allocation for the retrieved records may be satisfied from the FreeRecordPool.

Fixed-length datatypes (including objects) do not need to store this, because their Value length does not change.

ConcurrentWriter and InPlaceUpdater may change the record size, and need to know how much space they have available if they are to to be able to grow in place later: In-place updates in ConcurrentWriter and InPlaceUpdater use this to set the UpsertInfo and RMWInfo properties UsedValueLength and FullValueLength. These properties are discussed below. Revivification needs this to satisfy requests from the FreeRecordPool, and then also to set the UpsertInfo and RMWInfo properties UsedValueLength and FullValueLength. Storing the extra value length is done by rounding up the used value length (the current length of the value) to int boundary, and then if the allocated Value space is 4 bytes or more greater, storing the extra length at (start of Value plus rounded-up used space). Thus, the full value size is the rounded-up used value size plus the extra value size. If this extra length can be stored then the RecordInfo.Filler bit is set to indicate the extra length is present. Variable-length log allocations are 8-byte (RecordInfo size) aligned, so any extra length less than sizeof(int) can be inferred from this rounding up.","s":"Maintaining Extra Value Length","u":"/garnet/docs/dev/tsavorite/reviv","h":"#maintaining-extra-value-length","p":925},{"i":938,"t":"Storing the extra value length must be done carefully so we maintain the invariant that unused space is zeroed. This is necessary because log scans assume any non-zero data they land on past the previous record length is a valid RecordInfo header. If the extra length is set before the Filler bit is, or if the Filler bit is cleared before the extra length is zeroed, then a log scan could momentarily see a short length, land on the nonzero extra length, and think it is a valid RecordInfo. The other direction is safe: the filler bit may be set but the extra length is zero. In this case the scan sees a zeroed RecordInfo (RecordInfo.IsNull()) and assumes it is uninitialized space and steps forward by the size of a RecordInfo (8 bytes). This invariant is also followed when variable-length values are shrunk, even in the absence of the Filler bit. When a value is shrunk, the data beyond the new (shorter) size must be zeroed before the shorter size is set. Combining these two, when we adjust a variable-length value length, we must: Clear the extra value length. Remove Filler bit. Zero extra value data space past the new (shorter) size. Set the new (shorter) value length. Set the Filler bit. Set the extra value length to the correct new value.

For SpanByte, the VariableLenghtBlittableAllocator.GetValue overload with (physicalAddress, physicalAddress + allocatedSize) that calls the default SpanByte implementation of IVariableLengthStructureSettings actually initializes the value space to be a valid SpanByte that includes the requested Value length (up to the maximum number of elements that can fit).

Data written to the log will be seen by OnEvictionObserver if one is registered. However, revivified records are taken from the log and reused; thus they must give the application an opportunity to Dispose(). To handle this a new DisposeForRevivification IFunctions method has been added. When a record is moved to the FreeList, revivified from either in-chain or freelist, or is reused from Retry, it has a Key and potentially a Value. Tsavorite calls DisposeForRevivification twice: At the time a record is put on the FreeList. In this case the newKeySize parameter is -1, indicating that we are not reusing it yet. The main reason for this call is to release no-longer-used objects as soon as possible. For non-object types, there is minimal cost to this; fixed-length types do nothing, and the only Garnet variable-length type is SpanByte, which also does not need to do anything at this time (there are no allocations). DisposeForRevivification is not called for In-Chain tombstoned records; the key must remain valid, and the Value will be disposed at eviction. DisposeForRevivification is not called for Retry-recycled records at the time they are added to the PendingContext, because it is called when retrieving them and that is always done (we always retry). At the time of reuse, either from the FreeList or In-Chain, or from the Retry reuse, with newKeySize set to the actual size of the new key if being reused from the FreeList. This is only a concern for variable-length types and for Garnet that means SpanByte only, which ensures that the record is always zero-initialized such that it is \"valid\" for scan at any point. At reuse time, Tsavorite guarantees a valid Key and Value (even if the Value is default) are in the record, and calls DisposeForRevivification in the following way: Clears the extra value length and filler (the extra value length is retained in local variables). Calls DisposeForRevivification with newKeySize > 0 if the record was retrieved from the freelist If DisposeForRevivification clears the Value and possibly Key, it must do so in accordance with the protocol for zeroing data after used space as described in Maintaining Extra Value Length. SpanByte does not need to clear anything as a SpanByte contains nothing that needs to be freed. In a potentially breaking change from earlier versions, any non-SpanByte variable-length implementation must either implement DisposeForRevivification to zero-init the space or must revise its SingleWriter, InitialUpdater, and CopyUpdater implementations to recognize an existing value is there and handle it similarly to ConcurrentWriter or InPlaceUpdater. For SpanByte, SingleWriter et al. will have a valid target value in the destination for non-revivified records, because VariableLengthBlittableAllocator.GetAndInitializeValue (called after record allocation) calls the default SpanByte implementation of IVariableLengthStructureSettings and actually initializes the value space to be a valid SpanByte that includes the entire requested value size. For newly-allocated (not revivified) records the value data initialized to zero; for revivified records this is not guaranteed; only the value space after the usedValueLength is guaranteed to be zeroed, so SingleWriter et al. must be prepared to shrink the destination value.","s":"DisposeForRevivification","u":"/garnet/docs/dev/tsavorite/reviv","h":"#disposeforrevivification","p":925},{"i":944,"t":"If the FreeList is not active, all Tombstoned records are left in the hash chain; and even if the FreeList is active, a deleted record may not be elidable.

FreeList revivification functions as follows: Delete() checks to see if the record is at the tail of the hash chain (i.e. is the record in the HashBucketEntry). If it is not, then we do not try to freelist it due to complexity: TracebackForKeyMatch would need to return the next-higher record whose .PreviousAddress points to this one, and we would need to check whether that next-higher record had also been freelisted (and possibly revivified). Otherwise, Delete() checks to see if its PreviousAddress points below BeginAddress. If not, then we must leave it; it may be the marker for a deleted record below it, and removing it from the tag chain would allow the earlier record to be reached erroneously.

Multiple FreeRecordBins, one for each RevivificationBin in the RevivificationSettings with the corresponding number of records, max record size, and best-fit scan specification. Each element of a bin is a FreeRecord Each bin is a separate allocation, so the pool uses a size index which is a cache-aligned separate vector of ints of the bin sizes that is sequentially searched to determine the bin size. This avoids pulling in each bin’s separate cache line to check its size. FreeRecord Design​ A FreeRecord contains a free log address and the epoch in which it was freed; its data is a 'long' containing: the address (48 bits) and the size (16 bits) of the record at the address. If the size is > 2^16, then the record is \"oversize\" and its exact size is obtained from the hlog. The Address is stored similarly to RecordInfo.PreviousAddress, with the same number of bits The Size is shifted above the address, using the remaining bits. Thus it is limited to 16 bits; any free records over that size go into the oversize bin. Because this is only a long, we have atomic compare and exchange when setting and taking the address. FreeRecordBin Design​ The records of the bin are of sizes between [previous bin's max record size + 8] and [current bin's max record size]. As a shortcut we refer to bins by their max record size, i.e. \"the 64-byte bin\" means \"the bin whose min record size is 8 more than the max size of the previous bin, and whose max record size is 64.\" Each bin has a cache-aligned vector of FreeRecord that operates as a circular buffer. Unlike FIFO queues, we don't maintain a read/write pointer, for the following reasons: Some records in the bin will be smaller than the size requirement for a given allocation request; this could mean skipping over a number of records before finding a fit. With the pure FIFO approach this would lose a lot of records. The only solutions that keep the read/write pointer are to re-enqueue the skipped record(s), or some variation of peeking ahead of the read pointer, which would introduce complexity such as potentially blocking subsequent writes (the read pointer could be “frozen” but with many open elements beyond it that the write pointer can’t advance to). Maintaining the read and write pointers entails an interlock on every call, in addition to the Add/Remove interlock on the FreeRecord itself. We wish to obtain a solution that has only one interlock on read and write operations, does not iterate the entire segment, and makes a best effort at best-fit. To accomplish this we use a strategy of segmenting the bin by record sizes. Variable-Length Bin Segmenting​ For varlen Key and Value types, we segment bins based on the range of sizes at 8-byte alignment. First, the max number of records in the bin is rounded up to a cache-aligned size, and may be further rounded up to ensure that each segment starts on a cache boundary. FreeRecords are 16 bytes as stated above so there are 4 per cache line. However, 4 elements is too small for a segment, so we will require a minimum segment size of 8 (2 cache lines). This is a defined constant MinSegmentSize so can be modified if desired. We calculate bin segments by evenly dividing the number of records in the by by the range of possible 8-byte-aligned record sizes in the bin, with a minimum of two cache lines (8 items) per segment. Segments do not have read/write pointers; they are just the index to start at in the bin’s record array, calculated on the fly from the record size (if Adding) or the requested record size (if Taking). Here are 3 examples of determining the size ranges, using bin definitions as follow: A 32-byte bin and a 64-byte bin, both with 1024 records Intervening bins we will ignore but which end with a max record size of 2k A bin whose max record size is 4k and has 256 records. This example takes from the The following segmenting strategies are used: The 32-byte bin’s minimum size is 16 because it is the first bin. Because the sizes are considered in multiples of 8 or greater, it has 3 possible record sizes: 16, 24, 32. Thus we create internal segments of size 1024/3, then round this up so each segment has a record count that is a multiple of 4. Thus, each segment is 344 elements (1024/3 is 341.33...; round this up to multiple of MinSegmentSize), and there are 1032 total elements in the bin. These segments start at indexes 0, 344, 688. The 64-byte bin’s min record size is 40 (8 greater than the previous bin’s maximum). By the foregoing, it has 4 possible record sizes: 40, 48, 56, 64. 1024 is evenly divisible by 4 to MinSegmentSize-aligned 256, and therefore the segments start at 0, 256, 512, 768. The the size range of the larger bin has too many possible sizes to create one segment for each size, and therefore uses a different segment-calculation strategy. In this case the size range is 2k which divided by 8 is 256 possible record sizes within the bin. Dividing the bin record count by this yields 4 which is below the required MinSegmentSize, so instead we set the bin's segment count to MinSegementSize and divide the bin record count by that to get the number of segments (rounded up to integer), and then set the segment size increment to the size range divided by segment count. We therefore have 16 segments, and thus we divide the size range by 16 to get the record size ranges for the segments. The number of records is the segment size multiplied by the segment count. The segments are: Segment 0 starts at index 0 with max record size 2k+16 (thus, the segment may contain a mix of records of the following sizes: 2k+8, 2k+16) Segment 1 starts at index 8 with max record size 2k + 16*2 Segment 2 starts at index 16 with max record size, 2k+16*3 And so on Essentially the partitions are mini-bins that we can efficiently calculate the start offsets for based on record or request size. An alternative to size-based partitioning would be to use the thread id, as LightEpoch does. However, for threadId-based partitioning there is no organization to the size; we could have a random distribution of sizes. With size-based partitioning, we will much more likely land on the size (or close to it) that we want, and overflowing will put us into the next-highest record-size partition half the time, potentially giving us near-best-fit with minimal effort. Additionally, size-based partitioning makes best-fit search for a request easier. Best-Fit and First-Fit​ As the names imply, we have the option of first-fit or best-fit to satisfy a request. We allow both, via RevivificationBin.BestFitScanLimit: UseFirstFit: The value is zero, so we do not scan; when a record is requested from the bin, it returns the first one that has a size >= the requested size, has an addedEpoch >= SafeToReclaimEpoch, and has an address >= the minAddress passed to the Take call. BestFitScanAll: The value is Int.MaxValue, so we scan the entire bin (possibly wrapping), keeping track of the best fit, then try to return that (which may fail if another thread returned it first, in which case we retry). If at any point there is an exact fit, that bin attempts to return that record. Some other number < bin record count: Similar to BestFitScanAll except that it limits the number of records to scan. Fixed-Length Bins​ For fixed-length Key and Value datatypes there is only one bin and of course no size-based partitioning. In this case we could use thread-id-based partitioning (as could any sufficiently large partition) to determine the index within the partition to start iterating from. However, threadId-based partitioning suffers from the possibility that the writers write to different partitions than the readers read from; in the worst case the readers must wrap all the way around through all partitions to get to the records. This may be offset by the reduced cache-line ping-ponging between processor caches if the first 4 records of the partition are repeatedly updated by different threads, but this has not been tried. Checking for Empty Bins​ We do not want to maintain a per-operation counter of records in the FreeRecordPool or each FreeRecordBin because this would be an additional interlock per Add or Take. Because of this, we cannot have an \"accurate at all times\" indication of whether the pool or a bin are empty. However, checking empty bins is expensive, so we want to optimize this. There are numerous \"performance vs. accuracy\" trade-offs for setting one or more coarse-grained flags indicating whether the pool and/or individual bins are empty: Doing so at the pool level requires coordinating with all bins Doing so at the bin level requires knowing which bin a request maps to, which takes some calculations Obviously, an \"empty\" flag is set false by Add. However, it is not easy to set it true when Take has removed the last flag, since there may be an Add happening at the same time. The approach selected is to maintain bin-level isEmpty flags. Add always sets isEmpty to false. We do not clear isEmpty on Take() because that could lead to lost \"isEmpty = false\" flags due to Add. We maintain a worker Task that periodically iterates all bins to set IsEmpty true. This Task to iterate bins to set isEmpty is done by the CheckEmptyWorker class, which uses a separate on-demand Task to do the bump. It does this in a loop that performs: Wait for 1 second Scan: Scan each bin in the entire pool: If the bin is already marked isEmpty, do nothing Otherwise, iterate all entries in the bin: If an is found with a valid address, exit that bin's loop Otherwise, set that bin's isEmpty flag. CheckEmptyWorker has a Start method that is called by FreeRecordPool Add or Take. This Start method checks whether the CheckEmptyWorkerWorker has been started, and starts it if not. Because this is a persistent Task, it has a CancellationTokenSource that is signaled by CheckEmptyWorker.Dispose() when we are shutting down the TsavoriteKV. Fixed vs. VarLen​ For non-variable-length types, the record size is fixed, so the FreeRecordPool has only a single bin for it. Otherwise, it has the full range of variable-length bins. Adding a Record to the Pool​ When Adding a record to the pool: The caller calls FreeRecordPool.TryAdd. TryAdd scans the size index to find the bin index The bin at that index is called to Add the record The bin calculates the segment offset based on the record size, then does a linear scan to look for a free space (or a space whose address is < hlog.ReadOnlyAddress). If it finds one, the record is added with its address, size (if below 16 bits), and the currentEpoch at the time of the TryAdd call. TryAdd then returns true. else TryAdd returns false Taking a Record from the Pool​ When Taking a record, we must: Determine the bin corresponding to the requested size If the bin is empty, return Otherwise, any returned address must maintain the invariant that hash chains point downward; the HashTableEntry.Address is passed as a minimum required address. This is either a valid lower address or an invalid address (below BeginAddress). The operation then proceeds as: The caller calls FreeRecordPool.TryTake. TryTake scans the size index to find the bin index The bin at that index is called to try to Take the record The bin calculates the segment offset based on the record size, then does a linear scan to look for a record that is >= the required size and has an address >= the minAddress passed to the call. See Best-Fit and First-Fit for a discussion of which viable records are returned. If it finds a record matching this and can successfully CAS the bin to empty, the record is returned and TryTake returns true. Otherwise TryTake returns false","s":"FreeRecordPool Design","u":"/garnet/docs/dev/tsavorite/reviv","h":"#freerecordpool-design","p":925},{"i":952,"t":"This section discusses both of these because they were part of a change to add two additional type args, TStoreFunctions and TAllocator, to TsavoriteKV as well as the various sessions and *Context (e.g. BasicContext). The purpose of both of these is to provide better performance by inlining calls. StoreFunctions also provides better logical design for the location of the operations that are store-level rather than session-level, as described below. From the caller point of view, we have two new type parameters on TsavoriteKV<TKey, TValue, TStoreFunctions, TAllocator>. The TStoreFunctions and TAllocator are also on *.Context (e.g. BasicContext) as well. C# allows the 'using' alias only as the first lines of a namespace declaration, and the alias is file-local and recognized by subsequent 'using' aliases, so the \"Api\" aliases such as BasicGarnetApi in multiple files are much longer now.

As noted above, type parameters implemented by classes do not generate inlined code; the JITted code is general, for a single IntPtr-sized reference. For structs, however, the JITter generates code specific to that specific struct type, in part because the size can vary (e.g. when pushed on the stack as a parameter). There is a hack that allows a type parameter implemented by a class to be inlined: the generic type must be for a struct that wraps the class type and makes calls on that class type in a non-generic way. This is the approach the Allocator Wrapper takes: The BlittableAllocator, GenericAllocator, and SpanByteAllocator classes are now the wrapper structs, with Key, Value, and TStoreFunctions type args. These implement the IAllocator interface. There are new BlittableAllocatorImpl, GenericAllocatorImpl, and SpanByteAllocatorImpl classes that implement most of the functionality as previously, including inheriting from AllocatorBase. These also have Key, Value, and TStoreFunctions type args; the TAllocator is not needed as a type arg because it is known to be the XxxAllocator Wrapper struct. The wrapper structs contain an instance of the XxxAllocatorImpl class. AllocatorBase itself now contains a _wrapper field that is a struct-wrapper instance (which contains the instance pointer of the fully-derived allocator class) that is constrained to the IAllocator interface. AllocatorBase itself is templated on TStoreFunctions and TAllocator. The new Allocator definition supports two interfaces: IAllocatorCallbacks, which is inherited by IAllocator. This contains the derived-Allocator methods called by AllocatorBase that we want to inline rather then virtcall. The struct wrapper AllocatorBase._wrapper implements IAllocatorCallbacks, so the call on _wrapper inlines the call to IAllocatorCallbacks, which then calls down to the derived *AllocatorImpl class implementation. IAllocator : IAllocatorCallbacks. This is all inlined calls on the Allocator, including IAllocatorCallbacks. It turns out not to be possible to keep IAllocatorCalbacks as a separate type arg because IAllocator must propagate, but IAllocatorCallbacks remains as a separate interface (instead of combining it all into IAllocator) as the organization may be useful. There are still a number of abstract AllocatorBase methods, for which inlining of the method call is not important due to the time for the overall call. These are mostly IO and Scan/Iteration methods. Within TsavoriteKV, we have: hlog remains, but is now of type TAllocator (the wrapper struct). hlogBase is new; it is the AllocatorBase. All the calls on the allocator that we don’t need to inline (or are not virtual, such as *Address) are now called on hlogBase. It might be cleaner to rename these to allocator and allocatorBase. There is a new AllocatorSettings class as well that is created by TsavoriteKV when instantiating the allocator. Allocator instantiation is done by a factory Func<AllocatorSettings, TStoreFunctions> rather that being passed in as an object, because: The caller would have to know more internal stuff such as the epoch, whether to create readcache, and so on.

GetFirstArg(ref RawStringInput input): The GetFirseArg method is used to retrieve the argument from the input at offset 0. Registering the custom raw-string function is done on the server-side by calling the NewCommand(string name, int numParams, CommandType type, CustomRawStringFunctions customFunctions, long expirationTicks = 0) method on the Garnet server object's RegisterAPI object with its name, number of parameters, the CommandType (Read / ReadModifyWrite), an instance of the custom raw-string function class, and optionally the number of ticks for expiration.

To develop a new one, this class has to be extended and then include the custom logic. There are three methods to be implemented in a new custom transaction: Prepare<TGarnetReadApi>(TGarnetReadApi api, ref CustomProcedureInput procInput) Main<TGarnetApi>(TGarnetApi api, ref CustomProcedureInput procInput, ref MemoryResult<byte> output) Finalize<TGarnetApi>(TGarnetApi api, ref CustomProcedureInput procInput, ref MemoryResult<byte> output) The Prepare method implementation must setup the keys that will be involved in the transaction using utility methods available described below. The Main method is where the actual operation is to be performed as the locks required for the keys setup in the Prepare method are already obtained. The Main method then generates the output of the transaction as well. After the unlock of keys comes the Finalize phase, which can contain any non-transactional read and write operations on the store, and can write output as well. Finalize allows users to author complex non-transactional scripts as well: Prepare should simply return false, while Main is left unimplemented. These are the helper methods for developing custom transactions. AddKey(ArgSlice key, LockType type, bool isObject) This method is used to add a specified key to the locking set. It takes three parameters: key (the key to be added), type (the type of lock to be applied), and isObject (a boolean value indicating whether the key represents an object). RewindScratchBuffer(ref ArgSlice slice) This method is responsible for rewinding (popping) the last entry of the scratch buffer if it contains the given ArgSlice. It takes a reference to an ArgSlice parameter and returns a boolean value indicating whether the rewind operation was successful. CreateArgSlice(ReadOnlySpan<byte> bytes) This method is used to create an ArgSlice in the scratch buffer from a given ReadOnlySpan<byte>. It takes a ReadOnlySpan<byte> parameter representing the argument and returns an ArgSlice object. CreateArgSlice(string str) This method is similar to the previous one, but it creates an ArgSlice in UTF8 format from a given string. It takes a string parameter and returns an ArgSlice object. GetNextArg(ref CustomProcedureInput procInput, ref int offset) This method is used to retrieve the next argument from the input at the specified offset. It takes an ArgSlice parameter representing the input and a reference to an int offset. It returns an ArgSlice object representing the argument as a span. The method internally reads a pointer with a length header to extract the argument. These member functions provide utility and convenience methods for manipulating and working with the transaction data, scratch buffer, and input arguments within the CustomTransactionProcedure class. NOTE When invoking APIs on IGarnetApi multiple times with large outputs, it is possible to exhaust the internal buffer capacity. If such usage scenarios are expected, the buffer could be reset as described below. Retrieve the initial buffer offset using IGarnetApi.GetScratchBufferOffset Invoke necessary apis on IGarnetApi Reset the buffer back to where it was using IGarnetApi.ResetScratchBuffer(offset) Registering the custom transaction is done on the server-side by calling the NewTransactionProc(string name, int numParams, Func<CustomTransactionProcedure> proc) method on the Garnet server object's RegisterAPI object with its name, number of parameters and a method that returns an instance of the custom transaction class. It is possible to register the custom transaction from the client-side as well (as an admin command, given that the code already resides on the server) by using the REGISTERCS command (see Custom Commands).","s":"Developing custom server side transactions","u":"/garnet/docs/extensions/transactions","h":"#developing-custom-server-side-transactions","p":1013},{"i":1018,"t":"Custom transactions are executed by the RunTransactionProc method in the TransactionManager class. This method could be invoked either by calling the RUNTXP command with the custom transaction details or by using the custom transaction name used when registering. The initial phase is performed by invoking the Prepare method of the custom transaction which adds the keys that need to be locked using the AddKey method. If the Prepare method fails by returning false, the transaction manager's Reset(false) is called to reset itself. Otherwise, it proceeds to the next step of invoking the Run method of the TransactionManager class. See the description above for this method. If the Run method fails, the transaction manager is reset too. Next step, it proceeds to invoking the custom transaction's Main method implementation which performs the core logic of the transaction. On successful completion, it proceeds to log the transaction information. On the other hand, if the Main method fails by throwing an exception, Reset(true) is called to unlock any locked keys and reset itself. The Finalize phase is invoked at the end regardless of the success or failure of the actual transaction.

Here, we discuss the components of memory, and how to tune them. Configuration parameters are listed here. Garnet is designed as two storage instances of Tsavorite: the main store and the object store. Each one is independently configured for memory. If you use only raw strings (e.g., GET, SET and their variants), HYPERLOGLOG, and BITMAP commands, you should disable the object store using the DisableObjects (--no-obj) parameter. This will avoid wasting memory for the object store.","s":"Memory Usage","u":"/garnet/docs/getting-started/memory","h":"","p":1030},{"i":1033,"t":"Memory used by the main store consists of the sum of three components: Index size Log size Overflow buckets","s":"Main Store","u":"/garnet/docs/getting-started/memory","h":"#main-store","p":1030},{"i":1035,"t":"The index size is configured using the IndexSize (-i or --index) parameter.

The bucket holds 7 entries and a pointer to an overflow bucket, described below. The rule of thumb for sizing the index is: if you expect the cache-store to hold K keys, set the size to K * 16 bytes. The reasoning for this is: We want buckets to be half full on average, so around 4 keys per bucket Therefore, with K keys, we want K / 4 buckets Each bucket takes up 64 bytes So, the total size is 64 * (K / 4) = K * 16 bytes","s":"Index Size","u":"/garnet/docs/getting-started/memory","h":"#index-size","p":1030},{"i":1037,"t":"The index described above does not hold keys or values.

The page size controls the maximum key or value size you can store, as a record needs to fit entirely within a page. A record in the Garnet main store consists of: An 8-byte header, called RecordInfo, which holds metadata and the logical address of the previous entry in a record chain.

If the hash bucket for a given key is full, we overflow into extra buckets called overflow buckets that are allocated dynamically. While these cannot be controlled or bounded, they are typically very small and can be ignored. In case your index was sized too small, they can take up more space, and to combat this, you can dynamically grow the index as described below.","s":"Overflow buckets","u":"/garnet/docs/getting-started/memory","h":"#overflow-buckets","p":1030},{"i":1041,"t":"You can configure Garnet to automatically grow the index (doubling each time) as it fills up.

Index growth is triggered if the number of overflow buckets exceeds a specified percentage of the total number of main hash buckets. This threshold is specified using IndexResizeThreshold (--index-resize-threshold). We also support IndexMaxSize (--index-max-size) which identifies the maximum size until which the index will grow in size. We do not support index size shrinking at this point.","s":"Auto-Resizing Index","u":"/garnet/docs/getting-started/memory","h":"#auto-resizing-index","p":1030},{"i":1043,"t":"The index and overflow buckets are managed similarly to the main store, and the corresponding parameters are: ObjectStoreIndexSize (--obj-index) ObjectStoreIndexMaxSize (--obj-index-max-size) However, the log memory is handled differently, as described below.","s":"Object Store","u":"/garnet/docs/getting-started/memory","h":"#object-store","p":1030},{"i":1045,"t":"In case of the object store, the hybrid log holds references to keys and values (which are objects), rather than the actual keys and values themselves. The memory occupied by the object store log is configured using ObjectStoreLogMemorySize (--obj-log-memory). However, this parameter only controls the number of records in the object store, where each record consists of: An 8-byte header, called RecordInfo, which holds metadata and the logical address of the previous entry in a record chain. An 8-byte reference to the key object, which is a byte array on heap (byte[]) An 8-byte reference to the value object, which is an IGarnetObject instance, which could be different object types such as SortedSet, Hash, Set, etc. In other words, when you set ObjectStoreLogMemorySize, you are only controlling the number of records in memory, and not the total memory usage of the objects. Specifically, since each record is 24 bytes long, setting ObjectStoreLogMemorySize to S merely implies that you can hold at most S / 24 records in main memory. This means, of course, that we need to track the total memory using a different mechanism. For this, Garnet exposes a configuration called ObjectStoreHeapMemorySize (--obj-heap-memory) which represents the heap memory used by key byte arrays and the IGarnetObject instances in bytes. You can use this parameter in combination with the --obj-log-memory to control the total memory used by the object store. To summarize, the total space occupied by the object store is the sum of: Object store index size (and overflow buckets), as before ObjectStoreLogMemorySize (--obj-log-memory) which controls the maximum number of records in memory.

The network, processing, and storage (memory and disk/cloud) layers of Garnet are all designed from the ground up. We chose the RESP API as a matter of convenience given its broad adoption in the community. Garnet is not intended to be a 100% perfect drop-in replacement for Redis, rather it should be regarded as a close-enough starting point for you to ensure compatibility for features that matter to you. Garnet does work unmodified with many Redis clients (we have in particular tested Garnet with StackExchange.Redis very well), so getting started is very easy. A list of API calls supported today by Garnet is maintained here. Below we highlight specific non-API-related choices that may not be compatible. This list is not exhaustive, rather it is meant as a broad guideline on what differences you can expect when using Garnet. Garnet being multi-threaded, MSET is not atomic. For an atomic version of MSET, you would need to express it as a transaction (stored procedure). This is easily fixable, similar to MSETNX here, let us know in issues if you prefer the atomic semantics of MSET by default. Garnet does not support Redis modules. Instead, it has its own C# based extensibility mechanisms that are optimized for very high performance, thread scalability, safety, and ease of use. Garnet now has full-fledged and efficient support for Lua scripting. You can enable Lua with the --lua switch. Garnet respects the FIFO ordering of request-responses. However, when used with larger-than-memory data, and if you opt in to using the scatter-gather version of IO (using the EnableScatterGatherGet [--sg-get] option) for increased disk performance, then even though results are still returned in FIFO order, the read operations may be executed out-of-order to earlier write operations in the same input operation sequence. When Garnet is used with the append-only-file (AOF) turned on, by default the server does not wait for commit before returning success to the user. This can be adjusted using the WaitForCommit [--aof-commit-wait] option, while the frequency of commit can be tuned using the CommitFrequencyMs [--aof-commit-freq] option. You can disable the object store if your workload only consists of raw string operations, using the option DisableObjects [--no-obj]. The storage tier is disabled by default, and you can enable it using EnableStorageTier [--storage-tier]. You can disable the pub-sub feature using the option DisablePubSub [--no-pubsub].","s":"API Compatibility","u":"/garnet/docs/welcome/compatibility","h":"","p":1066},{"i":1070,"t":"This website is built using Docusaurus 2, a modern static website generator.
